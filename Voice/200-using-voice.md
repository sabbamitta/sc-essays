### Using Voice
The simplest way to use Voice is to click the 
<kbd>Inspire Me!</kbd>. This will bring up a small selection of related suttas for you to select:

<img aria-label="picture of inspire me button"
  src="/sc-voice/assets/img/inspire-me.png?raw=true" style="height:8em"/>

You can also enter searches of your own, such as <kbd>root of suffering</kbd> and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>

To find a particular sutta such as MN1, simply enter <kbd>mn1</kbd> 
in the search field. To find several suttas at once, 
separate the sutta references with a comma 
(for example, 
<kbd>an8.71 <span aria-label="comma"> </span><span aria-hidden="true">,</span> mn32 <span aria-label="comma"> </span><span aria-hidden="true">,</span> dn21</kbd>). If youâ€™d like to have some suttas suggested to you click on the 
<kbd>Inspire Me!</kbd> button. You can change the reading voice and other settings via the gear icon on the top right of the app.
