## Abstract
Im Folgenden untersuchen wir, ob der Gebrauch des Vokativs *bhikkhave* oder des Nominativs *bhikkhu* in buddhistischen kanonischen Texten bedeutet, dass weibliche Ordensangehörige von der Zuhörerschaft ausgeschlossen sind. Während wir diesen grundlegenden Punkt untersuchen, betrachten wir auch den Vokativ von Eigennamen und das Fehlen des Ausdrucks *arahantī* in der Pāli-Lehrredenliteratur.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref2" href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup>

## Einleitung
Die Ausdrücke *bhikkhave* und *bhikkhu*, und besonders ihr Auftreten in der buddhistischen Literatur auf Pāli, scheinen oberflächlich betrachtet eine Ausdrucksweise zu sein, die Frauen ausschließt. Die Vokativ-Anrede für Mönche (*bhikkhave* und seine Entsprechungen), die in der *Sutta*-Literatur so oft vorkommt, scheint darauf hinzuweisen, dass die dargelegten Unterweisungen ausschließlich an männliche Ordinierte gerichtet sind. In ähnlicher Weise scheint auch der Gebrauch des Nominativs *bhikkhu* (und seiner Entsprechungen) in Darstellungen, die mit der Lehre verbunden sind, anzuzeigen, dass einzig und allein Mönche das Anliegen derer sind, die die Lehre darlegen. Doch in beiden Fällen ist ein solches Verständnis des jeweiligen Begriffs problematisch.

In diesem Artikel besprechen wir jeden dieser Begriffe und schauen uns jeden etwas näher an. Wir schlagen vor, dass tatsächlich keiner dieser Ausdrücke im Sinn einer ausschließenden Sprache zu verstehen ist; das heißt, in keinem Fall sind diese Ausdrücke Indikatoren dafür, dass die Anrede oder das Element aus der Lehre nur für Mönche gedacht ist. Der Ausdruck *bhikkhave* sollte statdessen als eine Form von – wie wir es nennen – idiomatischem Vokativ Plural betrachtet werden; das ist ein Vokativ, der dafür gedacht ist, eine breitere Zuhörerschaft zu erfassen, als das vom eigentlichen Begriff selbst abgedeckt ist. Ähnlich ist *bhikkhu* im Sinn eines Nominativ-Sammelbegriffs gedacht, der „Mönch oder Nonne“ und manchmal auch „Laie“ bedeutet und als Oberbegriff zu verstehen ist. Zuerst besprechen wir den Ausdruck *bhikkhave*, dann *bhikkhu*, und danach fügen wir noch eine Bemerkung zu dem Ausdruck *arhantī* ein.

## 1. *Bhikkhave* im Pālikanon
Die Vokativ-Anrede für Mönche erscheint im Pālikanon in zwei Formen: *bhikkhave* und *bhikkhavo*, wobei *bhikkhave* die am weitesten verbreitete Form ist.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref3" href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> Frühere Wissenschaftler wie Bechert haben Theorien über den Gebrauch der beiden entwickelt, d. h., weshalb eher die eine als die andere benutzt wurde; doch heute, mit unserem gegenwärtigen Verständnis der mündlichen und der Manuskripttradition, liegt der offensichtlichste Grund für die beiden Arten, den Vokativ Plural zu deklinieren, einfach darin, dass die Texte, die den Pālikanon bilden, aus verschiedenen Schichten bestehen, die mit der Zeit ihre jetzige Form erhielten.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref4" href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> 

Das Folgende Beispiel aus dem *Saṃyutta-Nikāya* ist typisch dafür, wie die Vokativ-Anrede vorkommt:

<blockquote>Bhikkhus, gebt alles auf, was nicht euer ist. Wenn ihr es aufgegeben habt, wird das zu eurem Wohl und Glück führen. Und was, Bhikkhus, ist nicht euer? Bhikkhus, Form ist nicht euer: Gebt sie auf. Wenn ihr sie aufgegeben habt, wird das zu eurem Wohl und Glück führen … <sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref5" href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></blockquote>

So erscheint der Ausdruck in der Mehrzahl der Texte des Pālikanon, allerdings nicht in den Texten in Versform wie dem *Dhammapada*, dem *Theratherīgāthā* und dem *Sutta-Nipāta*. Diese [englische; Anm. d. Übers.] Übersetzung ist Bhikkhu Bodhis Übersetzung [deutsche Übersetzung davon ausgehend; Anm. d. Übers.], in der allerdings der Vokativ in allen Fällen wieder eingefügt wurde. Der Ausdruck erscheint sehr viel öfter, als Bhikkhu Bodhi ihn übersetzt. Zum Beispiel übersetzt Bhikkhu Bodhi ihn im *Ariyapariyesanā-Sutta* des *Majjhima-Nikāya* nur zwölfmal, während er in der vorhandenen PTS-Ausgabe des Pālikanon 121 Mal in dem *Sutta* vorkommt. Auch erscheint er im *Sakka-Saṃyutta* des *Saṃyutta-Nikāya* in der PTS-Ausgabe 105 Mal, aber nur sechzig Mal in Bhikkhu Bodhis Übersetzung.

Wenn wir diese Häufigkeiten mit einigen *Sutta*parallelen aus anderen Traditionen vergleichen, springen manche Unterschiede zwischen den Zahlen ins Auge. In der Parallele zum *Sakka-Saṃyutta* aus dem kürzeren *Saṃyukta-Āgama* in Marcus Bingenheimers Übersetzung erscheint der Ausdruck nur achtmal, verglichen mit 105 Mal in der PTS-Ausgabe. In der (ersten Hälfte  der) Parallele zum *Ariyapariyesanā-Sutta* im chinesischen *Madhyama-Āgama*, übersetzt von Anālayo („Brahmā’s“), erscheint der Ausdruck nur zweimal, verglichen mit 121 Mal in der vollständigen PTS-Ausgabe.

However, the differences are not always so great. In the *Māra-saṃyukta* from the shorter *Saṃyukta-āgama*, the term does not appear at all, and in the Pāli only seventeen times, as many of the sections are just the Buddha and Māra in dialogue. Similarly, in other *suttas* in which the Buddha dialogues with just one or two people, or groups who are not his followers, there are no occurrences of the term in either the Pāli or Chinese.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref6" href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup>

In Gāndhārī parallels of fragments of some *suttas* the vocative address is sometimes missing, even if the parallel is otherwise exact. This is most evident in Glass’s study of four *Saṃyukta-āgama sūtras*. There are seven instances for comparison. Of these, on four occasions the Pāli has the vocative address, whilst the Gāndhārī does not. On two occasions both have the vocative address, and on the other occasion, the Pāli has *bhikkhave* three times whilst in the Gāndhārī the equivalent—*bhikṣave*—occurs only once. The last instance is as follows:
> Pāli—*yam **bhikkhave** na tumhākaṃ tam pajahatha. Taṃ vo pahīnaṃ hitāya sukhāya bhavissati. Kiñca **bhikkave** na tumhākam. Rūpam **bhikkave** na tumhākaṃ tam pajahatha.*
> 
> Gāndhārī (Reconstructed)—*ya **bhikṣave** ṇa tuspahu ta praca{ja}asa ta prahiṇa hiḏae suhae bhavi(*śaḏi kica ṇa) (*tuspahu)u ruo ṇa tuspahu ta pajaasa …* (Glass 178)

The other four examples with the missing vocative are as follows:
> Pāli—*seyyathāpi **bhikkhave** yam imasmiṃ jetavane tiṇakaṭṭhasākhāpalāsam taṃ jano hareyya vā ḍaheyya vā yathāpaccayaṃ vā kareyya.*
>
> Gāndhārī (Reconstructed) - *sayasavi yo himaspi jeḏavaṇe triṇa-kaṭha-śaha-patra-palaśa ta jaṇe chidea va harea v(*a dahea ve yasapa)c(*e)a karea …* (Glass 180)
>
> Pāli—*evam eva kho bhikkave rūpaṃ na tumhākam.*
>
> Gāndhārī (Reconstructed)—*evam eva ya ṇa tuspahu …* (Glass 183)
>
> Pāli—*bhāvanānuyogaṃ ananuyuttassa bhikkhave bhikkhuno viharato …*
>
> Gāndhārī (Reconstructed)—*bhavaṇaṇuyoḵa aṇaṇuyutasa bhikhusa viharaḏe …* (Glass 205)
>
> Pāli—*seyyathāpi bhikkhave kukkuṭiyā aṇḍāni aṭṭha vā dasa vā dvádasa vā …*
>
> Gāndhārī (Reconstructed)—*saysavi kukuḍ(*ia aḍagaṇi a)ṭh(*a) va daśa va baḏaśa va …* (Glass 207)

All these examples are from the *Saṃyukta-āgama*, as many of the other Gāndhārī fragments are from texts that do not contain the vocative address—such as the *Dhammapada*, or of texts with no direct Pāli equivalent. Mark Allon’s survey of the three *Ekottarika-āgama*-type *sūtras* does not afford good comparison, as unfortunately most often the vocatives, if they had been there, would have come at the left hand side of the line, which is missing in the fragments. Allon has reconstructed the lines with the vocative address as it is in parallel Pāli passages, but it is unclear from the manuscript fragments as to whether it was there on the complete manuscript or not.

## 2. Mahāsāṅghika-Lokottaravāda *Bhikṣuṇī Vinaya*
In the Pāli *Vinaya* the vocative address appears often, even in the nuns’ section—and in discussing this we touch on observations made previously by Anālayo (“Theories”) and von Hinüber (“Foundation”). In the nuns’ section, when an event happens the nuns tell the monks, who tell the Buddha and then the Buddha makes a ruling for the nuns, but uses the vocative *bhikkhave*. If we understand the use of the term here in its most literal sense, then the Buddha seems to be instructing the monks about rules for nuns.

In sharp contrast to the vocative address featuring extensively in the nuns’ section of the Pāli *Vinaya*, it is absent from the Mahāsāṅghika-Lokottaravāda *Bhikṣuṇī Vinaya*. The Mahāsāṅghika-Lokottaravāda *Bhikṣuṇī Vinaya* begins with the Buddha instructing Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī to gather together the community of nuns and once she has done so he will give the teaching of the rules. Also, in relation to the individual rules, after events have happened and Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī has explained the situation to the Buddha, the Buddha instructs her to gather together the nuns (even those who may have heard the ruling before) so that he can pronounce the ruling. In this case, then, as stipulated, the audience for both the entire exposition and individual rules is entirely female and monastic.

In this text, I found no examples of the vocative address to monks, nor was there the female equivalent. Instead, when the Buddha does address the collected assembly with a particular term, he addresses them as one assembly—the terms used are either *āryamiśrikā*, *āryamiśrā* or *āryā saṅgho*,—that is the Buddha addresses the collective as “Assembly of Venerable Nuns” or “Community of Venerable Nuns.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref7" href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> However, in the majority of the time, no vocatives are used, and the Buddha simply pronounces a rule, with the preface of “*bhagavān āha*.”
> *yāciṣyati āryamiśrā* … —it is said, Assembly of Venerable Nuns … (Roth *Bhikṣuṇī-Vinaya* 240)
>
> *ṣrṇotu me āryā saṃgho* … —Listen to me, Community of Venerable Nuns … (Roth *Bhikṣuṇī-Vinaya* 241 (twice) and 243)

The Buddha addresses the entire assembly as a collective, and does not pick out seniors amongst them to address, even though it is clear throughout the Mahāsāṅghika-Lokottaravāda *Bhikṣuṇī Vinaya* that Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī is considered the most senior of the nuns.

## 3. Idiomatic Vocative of Proper Names in the Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivāda *Vinaya* and in Pāli Texts
Contrary to the case of the Mahāsāṅghika-Lokottaravāda *Bhikṣuṇī Vinaya*, in the Mūlasarvāstivāda *Vinaya* preserved in Tibetan translation the Buddha uses the idiomatic plural vocative of the name of Gautamī. The episode in question reports how five hundred *bhikṣuṇīs*, who are followers of Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, ask the Buddha to allow them to enter Nirvāṇa before he passes away. He replies:
<blockquote>Gautamīs, for what reason do you say you [wish to enter] Nirvāṇa?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref8" href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup></blockquote>

A comparable pattern can be seen in several Pāli discourses, where the Buddha uses the expression *vo ānanda*, used by the Buddha when giving a teaching in the presence of his chief attendant.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref9" href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> The pronoun *vo*, the enclitic of *tumhe*, corresponds to the plural “you.” In this way, the combination of the plural “you” with the singular name Ānanda indicates that the teaching was addressed to the Buddha’s attendant and at the same time to whoever else happened to form the audience for that particular teaching.

When the construction *vo* followed by a proper name is used for someone who represents a specific group, the proper name itself can also take the plural form, similar to the Mūlasarvāstivāda *Vinaya* passage mentioned above. This is the case for Anuruddha on occasions when he is addressed together with his close companions. Here is one such passage from the *Naḷakapāna-sutta*, which reports the Buddha deciding to ask a question of Anuruddha and his companions:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref10" href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup>
> Then the Blessed One had this thought: “What if I now question those clansmen?” Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Anuruddha: “Anuruddhas, do you (plural) delight in the holy life?”

The same type of usage can also be found in the *Cūḷagosinga-sutta* and the *Upakkilesa-sutta*. Each of these two discourses reports the Buddha addressing Anuruddha and his companions Nandiya and Kimbila with the plural form *anuruddhā*, “Anuruddhas.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref11" href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup> This form of address is clearly not meant to exclude the other two.

The same type of usage recurs in relation to Sāriputta in the Pāli *Vinaya*, taking the form *sāriputtā*. In what follows I translate two examples. The first concerns the need to deal with the misbehavior of the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka, on being informed of which the Buddha addresses Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref12" href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup>
> [The Blessed One] addressed Sāriputta and [Mahā]moggallāna: “Sāriputtas, you (plural) go and, having gone to Kīṭāgiri, carry out an act of banishment from Kīṭāgiri against the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka.”

The second instance is related to Devadatta. The Buddha has just been informed that the schismatic Devadatta has gathered a substantial following of *bhikkhus*, whereupon the Buddha asks Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna to bring these *bhikkhus* back:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref13" href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup>
> “Sāriputtas, would you (plural) not have compassion for those newly ordained monks? Sāriputtas, you (plural) go, before those monks fall into trouble and misfortune.” Having heard the Blessed One, Sāriputta and [Mahā]moggallāna [said]: “Very well, venerable sir.”

Clearly in this instance, too, the proper name of a single person is used in the plural form to express that the form of address is not meant in an exclusive manner.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref14" href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup> The choice of Sāriputta over Mahāmoggallāna reflects the fact that Sāriputta was considered the chief disciple of the Buddha and thus more prominent than other eminent disciples.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref15" href="#fn15">[15]</a></sup> In this way, a group of two or more can be referred to by using a plural form of the name of the most eminent member of the group.

The case of Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna also shows that such usage need not be discriminatory. The fact that Mahāmoggallāna is not explicitly mentioned does not imply that the Buddha favored Sāriputta over Mahāmoggallāna, or that Mahāmoggallāna’s abilities did not receive their deserved recognition and he was slighted at the expense of Sāriputta. Instead, it only reflects the fact that, by directly addressing those higher in the hierarchy, those not explicitly mentioned are also included.

## 4. Idiomatic Vocative in Other Sources
The cases above clearly demonstrate the use of the idiomatic vocative in Pāli and indicates at least one use of it in Tibetan. In texts in other Indic languages, the usage is less clear. For instance, in the Gāndhārī fragments of the *Cūḷagosiṅga-sutta*, the name Anuruddha (G. Aṇarudha) is not obviously in the plural, although a plural may be intended.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref16" href="#fn16">[16]</a></sup>

However, there is an example of the idiomatic vocative in the Sanskrit Mūlasarvāstivāda *Vinaya*. In the opening section of Gnoli’s edited text of the *Saṅghabhedavastu*, a group of Śākyans desiring to know the origins of their clan approaches the Buddha to request he narrate this. The Buddha instructs Maudgalyāyana to do the honors. When Maudgalyāyana sits down to begin his narration, he addresses the gathered Śākyans as “Gautamā”—that is, he addresses them with a plural vocative. In this instance, it appears that plural vocative is being used as the name of the principal family of the group, rather than an individual, as in the examples above. Gautama is, of course, the personal name of the Buddha, but in this instance the Buddha sits (both metaphorically and literally) outside of the group being addressed. The vocative here is used again idiomatically, in a hierarchical formulation, whereby the principal group in an assembly is addressed by name, but the address is an address to the entire group. Here is the text:
> The Buddha, the Blessed One, was staying in Kapilavastu, in the Nyagrodha Park. At that time, many Śākyans of Kapilavastu were gathered together in one house, and amongst them a discussion of this sort arose: “What is the origin of the Śākyans? Who were the first, who followed, and who amongst the Śākyans are the oldest family lineage?” … Then the many Śākyans of Kapilavastu approached the Buddha [and put the question to him] … Then the Blessed One said to Venerable Maudgalyāyana: “Tell them, Venerable Maudgalyāyana, [begin] the lineage of the ancient Śākyan family …” … having sat down, Maudgalyāyana addressed the Śākyans of Kapilavastu: “It was, Gautamās, during this time when this earth was coming into being …” (Gnoli 5-7)

As this instance is concerned with family and clan, it raises the question as to whether this use of the vocative is attested in contemporaneous Brahmanical literature. There is, as far as I know, no evidence of this idiomatic use of the vocative in such literature.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref17" href="#fn17">[17]</a></sup>

In discussing the matter with Simon Brodbeck, he pointed out that in the *Mahābhārata*, in instances in which the five Pāṇḍavas and Draupadī are conversing with some teacher or another, usually Yudhiṣṭhira will do the talking, and the interlocutor will then address Yudhiṣṭhira by way of a singular vocative in reply, even though the address is meant for all present.

Examples of this can be found in, for instance the *Vanaparvan*, the *Śāntiparvan*, and the *Anuśāsanaparvan*. In one example in the *Vanaparvan*, Yudhiṣṭhira asks sage Mārkaṇḍeya if he has ever known a woman as pure and virtuous as Draupadī, and when Mārkaṇḍeya replies with a story of such a woman, he begins his narrative “Listen, King Yudhiṣṭhira …” (*śṛṇu rājan … yudhiṣṭhira* Mbh 3.293.4) although his story is intended for all the five brothers present.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref18" href="#fn18">[18]</a></sup> Then, at the conclusion of the *Āraṇyakaparvan*, the five brothers ask a question of the sages, who reply reminding them of edifying tales of others who have suffered similarly to themselves. This is clearly intended for all the brothers, but again addressed to Yudhiṣṭhira alone (with the vocative *rājan* Mbh 3.315.11). These examples do not mirror the examples above from Buddhist texts. A replica of the Anuruddha example (for instance) in these cases would entail the name Yudhiṣṭhira in the plural not singular.

Similarly, in Jain texts there is no evidence of an idiomatic plural vocative used in this way.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref19" href="#fn19">[19]</a></sup> In Jain texts I have consulted, there is usually just an imperative such as “Listen to me” or “Look” or “See” where we might find *bhikkhave* in the Pāli, and no similar vocative used. So, it does appear that this usage is specific of Buddhist texts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref20" href="#fn20">[20]</a></sup>

In addition to the usage we have been able to identify being confined to Buddhist texts, the instances in which these plural vocatives appear can be considered quite particular, and their particularity may be an indication of how this idiomatic use of the vocative began to develop in early Indian Buddhist communities.

In the Sanskrit Mūlasarvāstivāda *Vinaya*, the idiomatic plural vocative is used in a narrative about the origins of the Śākyan clan, and the Gautama family, for the Śākyans are immensely important. The *Upakkilesa-sutta*, with Anuruddha, is well known as one of the best examples of how followers of the Buddha can live together in perfect harmony. Further, Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna are well known to be close companions. In each of these cases, the relationships between members of the groups or the pair in question are either very close ones, or particularly significant ones. These examples, together with a lack of equivalents in contemporaneous religious literature, suggest a burgeoning development of this type of mode of address in some early Indian Buddhist communities, perhaps used as an indicator of significant relationships between members of a group or pairs of individuals.

## 5. *Aṭṭhakathā* Exegesis
The Pāli commentarial tradition provides glosses on the term *bhikkhave*. These confirm our argument in relation to the idiomatic use of the vocative. For instance, the types of short exegesis of the term often found in the *aṭṭhakathās* are as follows:
<blockquote><em><strong>bhikkhave</strong> ti paṭissavena abhimukhībhūtānaṃ puna ālapanaṃ.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref21" href="#fn21">[21]</a></sup>

<em><strong>bhikkhave</strong> ti yo koci bhikkhu vā bhikkhunī vā upāsako vā upāsikā vā.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref22" href="#fn22">[22]</a></sup>

<em><strong>bhikkhū āmantesī</strong> ti parisa-jeṭṭhake bhikkhū jānāpesi. <strong>Bhikkhavo</strong> ti tesaṃ āmantaṇ’ ākāra-dīpanaṃ.</em> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref23" href="#fn23">[23]</a></sup> </blockquote>

These three examples—with *bhikkhave* and *bhikkhavo*—show the range of exegesis: the vocative address *bhikkhave/ bhikkhavo* can refer to all those gathered who show reverence, or it can mean one who is a monk, nun, layman or laywomen, or it can be said, more specifically, to be an address to the elder monks in the community. And with regards to this last comment, there are longer sections of exegesis of *bhikkhave*, such as a passage repeated in the commentaries on the first occurrence of the term in the *Majjhima-nikāya*, the *Saṃyutta-nikāya* and the *Aṅguttara-nikāya*. The passage states that while the literal address is to the senior monks, it is not intended as exclusive. Firstly, *bhikkhavo* is said to refer those who are fit to hear the discourse—
<blockquote><em><strong>Bhikkhavo</strong></em> explaining the address—said to be those who are capable and able in the group, starting with those with the character of mendicant.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref24" href="#fn24">[24]</a></sup></blockquote>

Following this, the text of the *aṭṭhakathās* then asks—But other men and gods are present, why are only monks addressed?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref25" href="#fn25">[25]</a></sup> And the reply is as follows:
<blockquote>The elders and best are nearest, because they are always close. But the <em>dhamma</em> teaching of the Blessed One is applicable to all in the assembly, and in the assembly, the elder monks have become foremost; the excellent ones, living the homeless life, etc., they follow the way of the
teacher and themselves grasped the entire dispensation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref26" href="#fn26">[26]</a></sup></blockquote>

And with regards to those who have the privilege of being close to the teacher, the passage continues:
<blockquote>Those who are near, sat there, they are in the presence of the teacher, always close, they are companions of the teacher. And also, just as they are instructed in this portion of <em>dhamma</em> teaching, it is said, honoring this method, they are addressed similarly [elsewhere].<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref27" href="#fn27">[27]</a></sup></blockquote>

Here the *aṭṭhakathās* gloss the vocative address as idiomatic, as we have been discussing. The Buddha addresses the monks, or the elder monks, who sit closest to him, but he is talking to all those who are gathered. And, as the last quoted passage says, this is how the Buddha’s disciples are instructed in this case, and it is usually this way.

## 6. The Use of the Nominatives *bhikkhu* and *bhikkhunī*
In addition to the case of the vocative *bhikkhave*, discussed so far, in what follows I take up the use of the nominative *bhikkhu* and/or *bhikkhunī* based on three examples. The first example comes in a discourse on *bhikkhunīs* in the *Saṃyutta-nikāya* and its *Saṃyukta-āgama* parallel, which throw into relief the expertise of a group of *bhikkhunīs* in their *satipaṭṭhāna* practice. The other two examples are from the *Majjhima-nikāya* and the *Aṅguttara-nikāya*, namely the *Cetokhila-sutta* and the *Yuganaddha-sutta* (together with their parallels), to which I will turn subsequently.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref28" href="#fn28">[28]</a></sup> I begin by translating the first part of the discourse on *bhikkhunīs* in the *Saṃyukta-āgama*:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref29" href="#fn29">[29]</a></sup>
<blockquote>[Discourse on *bhikkhunīs*]<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref30" href="#fn30">[30]</a></sup>

Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.

At that time the venerable Ānanda put on his robes in the morning and took his bowl to enter the town of Sāvatthī to beg alms. On the way he thought: “Let me now first go to the monastic dwelling (<em>vihāra</em>) of the <em>bhikkhunīs</em>.” He promptly went to the monastic dwelling of the <em>bhikkhunīs</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref31" href="#fn31">[31]</a></sup>

On seeing from afar that the venerable Ānanda was coming, the <em>bhikkhunīs</em> swiftly prepared a seat and invited him to sit down.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref32" href="#fn32">[32]</a></sup> Then the <em>bhikkhunīs</em> paid respect at the feet of the venerable Ānanda, withdrew to sit to one side, and said to the venerable Ānanda: “We <em>bhikkhunīs</em> are established in cultivating the four establishments of mindfulness with a [well] collected mind, and we ourselves know successively more or less [lofty stages].”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="33" href="#fn33">[33]</a></sup>

The venerable Ānanda said to the <em>bhikkhunīs</em>: “It is well, it is well, Sisters, one should train as you have described. One who is established in cultivating all four establishments of mindfulness with a well collected mind should in this way know successively more or less [lofty stages].”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref34" href="#fn34">[34]</a></sup> Then the venerable Ānanda taught the Dharma in various ways to the <em>bhikkhunīs</em>. Having taught the Dharma in various ways, he rose from his seat and left.

At that time, after having returned from begging alms in Sāvatthī, having stored away his robe and bowl, and having washed his feet, the venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One. He paid respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet, withdrew to sit to one side, and fully told the Blessed One what the <em>bhikkhunīs</em> had said.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref35" href="#fn35">[35]</a></sup></blockquote>

Ānanda’s report of the way of practice of the *bhikkhunīs* meets with the Buddha’s approval, who then takes this as the occasion for delivering a talk on such practice. The talk proceeds in this way:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref36" href="#fn36">[36]</a></sup>
<blockquote>“Suppose a <em>bhikkhu</em> is established in mindfully contemplating the body as a body.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref37" href="#fn37">[37]</a></sup> Having become established in mindfully contemplating the body as a body, suppose the body is affected by drowsiness and the mental factors are sluggish.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref38" href="#fn38">[38]</a></sup> That <em>bhikkhu</em> should arouse inspired confidence by taking hold of an inspiring sign.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref39" href="#fn39">[39]</a></sup>

“Having aroused a mental state of inspired confidence by recollecting an inspiring sign, his mind becomes delighted. [His mind] having become delighted, joy arises. His mind having become joyous, his body becomes tranquil. His body having become tranquil, he experiences happiness with his whole being.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref40" href="#fn40">[40]</a></sup> Having experienced happiness with his whole being, his mind becomes concentrated.”</blockquote>

Even though the first half of the discourse is concerned with the *satipaṭṭhāna* practice undertaken by *bhikkhunīs*, on being informed about this the Buddha describes *satipaṭṭhāna* practice of *bhikkhus*, without mentioning *bhikkhunīs* at all. The same is the case for the *Saṃyutta-nikāya* parallel.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref41" href="#fn41">[41]</a></sup> This raises the question if the shift from *bhikkhunīs* to *bhikkhus* is an expression of gender prejudice, in the sense that the actual practice of the *bhikkhunīs* does not receive the recognition it deserves. To explore this further, I turn to the second of the three passages mentioned earlier.

This second passage occurs in the *Cetokhila-sutta*, a discourse found in the *Majjhima-nikāya* as well as in the *Aṅguttara-nikāya*, with parallels in the *Madhyama-āgama* and the *Ekottarika-āgama*. In all versions the Buddha begins a sermon by highlighting the need to overcome two sets of five mental obstructions. I begin with a translation of the *Madhyama-āgama* version:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref42" href="#fn42">[42]</a></sup>
> “If a *bhikkhu* or a *bhikkhunī* has not uprooted five mental defilements and has not become free from five mental bondages, I say that *bhikkhu* or *bhikkhunī* will certainly decline in the Dharma. What are the five mental defilements that have not been uprooted? Suppose someone has doubt about the Blessed One and is hesitant …”

This presentation appears unproblematic from a gender perspective. The passage sets out by mentioning defilements and bondages that would affect *bhikkhus* just as well as *bhikkhunīs*, and then continues to expound the first of these defilements, doubt about the Buddha, by simply speaking of “someone.” The same is not the case for the *Ekottarika-āgama* version, which reads as follows:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref43" href="#fn43">[43]</a></sup>

> “If a *bhikkhu* or a *bhikkhunī* has not eradicated five mental maladies and has not gotten rid of five mental bondages, that *bhikkhu* or *bhikkhunī* day and night will decline and not grow in wholesome states. What are the five mental maladies that have not been eradicated? In this way a *bhikkhu* has doubt in his mind in relation to the Tathāgata …”

In the *Ekottarika-āgama* version the passage also sets out by mentioning a problem that can affect *bhikkhus* just as well as *bhikkhunīs*. But when it comes to the actual exposition, it only envisages a *bhikkhu* having doubt about the Buddha.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref44" href="#fn44">[44]</a></sup> The same pattern holds for the rest of the *Ekottarika-āgama* discourse, where in the case of each mental obstruction only a *bhikkhu* is mentioned.

On a literal reading of the *Ekottarika-āgama* exposition, one would have to conclude that it considers mental obstructions to be occurring only in the case of *bhikkhus*. Since *bhikkhunīs* are not mentioned, it would follow that from the perspective of this discourse they do not experience doubt about the Buddha or any other of the mental maladies and mental bondages discussed in the discourse.

Such a reading is of course made impossible by the introductory phrase, which explicitly states that these two sets of five obstructions need to be overcome by both *bhikkhus* and *bhikkhunīs*, not only by *bhikkhus*.

A similar contrast between the introductory statement and the body of the exposition can also be seen in the *Aṅguttara-nikāya* version, where the relevant passage proceeds in this way:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref45" href="#fn45">[45]</a></sup>
> “*Bhikkhus*, whatever *bhikkhu* or *bhikkhunī* has not abandoned the five kinds of mental barrenness and not cut off the five bondages of the mind, of him deterioration in wholesome states is to be expected, come day, come night, not growth. What are the five kinds of mental barrenness that he has not abandoned? Here, *bhikkhus*, a *bhikkhu* has doubt about the teacher and hesitation …”

In this passage the use of the masculine singular genitive *tassa*, which I have translated “of him,” is already found in the introductory phrase. This is so even though it follows a reference to a *bhikkhu* or a *bhikkhunī*, a shift confirmed by the use of only the term *bhikkhu* when it comes to expounding the first mental barrenness. On adopting a prima facie reading in the case of this presentation, one would have to conclude not only that *bhikkhus* stand alone in having doubt, but it is also only for *bhikkhus* that doubt and the other mental obstructions lead to deterioration instead of growth. Clearly, such a reading fails to make sense.

Besides the *Aṅguttara-nikāya* discourse, another version of the same discourse can be found in the *Majjhima-nikāya* of the same Pāli canon, and this version shows a significant difference. The relevant part reads as follows:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref46" href="#fn46">[46]</a></sup>
> “*Bhikkhus*, whatever *bhikkhu* has not abandoned the five kinds of mental barrenness and not cut off the five bondages of the mind, that he should come to prosperity, growth, and abundance in this Dharma and discipline, that is impossible. What are the five kinds of mental barrenness that he has not abandoned? Here, *bhikkhus*, a *bhikkhu* has doubt about the teacher and hesitation …”

So here the *bhikkhunīs* are not mentioned at all, right from the outset. Had this discourse been from a different reciter tradition, one might even wonder if this expresses an even stronger gender bias, in the sense of discrimination against male monastics. It consistently takes up only the case of *bhikkhus* having these mental obstructions and does not envisage at all that *bhikkhunīs* could have any relation to these.

The fact that this discourse is part of the same oral transmission of Pāli discourses by Theravāda reciters as the *Aṅguttara-nikāya* version that does mention *bhikkhunīs* points of course in a different direction. The solution to the conundrum posed by the examples surveyed so far is simply that the term *bhikkhu* does not automatically restrict an exposition to male monastics alone, but can rather act as an umbrella term that includes *bhikkhunīs* as well as *sāmaṇeras*, *sikkhamānās*, and *sāmaṇerīs*, in short, all monastics independent of their gender or level of ordination.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref47" href="#fn47">[47]</a></sup> In fact at times the usage of *bhikkhu* may not even intend to refer only to monastics, but may also include laity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref48" href="#fn48">[48]</a></sup> Thus it would not be correct to assume that, e.g., because the instructions in the *Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta* are addressed to *bhikkhus*, it follows that during the early period of Buddhism only monks were expected to engage in mindfulness practice.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref49" href="#fn49">[49]</a></sup>

The functioning of *bhikkhu* as an umbrella term can also be seen from the third passage to be examined, which occurs in the *Yuganaddha-sutta* and its *Saṃyukta-āgama* parallel. In both versions Ānanda is the speaker. Here comes an extract from the *Saṃyukta-āgama* version.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref50" href="#fn50">[50]</a></sup>
> “If a *bhikkhu* or a *bhikkhunī* declare themselves in front of me, I will approve and rejoice, and then inquire which of these four paths they pursued. What are the four?
>
> “Suppose a *bhikkhu* or a *bhikkhunī* while sitting [in meditation] in this way settle the mind, well settle the mind, definitely settle the mind, and train the mind in tranquility and insight …”

The discourse continues with more details on this particular path and then describes another three paths adopted by “*bhikkhus* or *bhikkhunīs*” who declare themselves in front of Ānanda, that is, who in his presence proclaim to have reached awakening. The corresponding exposition in the *Aṅguttara-nikāya* parallel reads as follows:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref51" href="#fn51">[51]</a></sup>
<blockquote>“Friends, whatever *bhikkhu* or *bhikkhunī* declares to have reached <em>arahant</em>-ship in my presence, they all do so by these four paths,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref52" href="#fn52">[52]</a></sup> or by a certain one among them. What are the four? Here, friends, a <em>bhikkhu</em> cultivates insight preceded by tranquility …”</blockquote>

The *Aṅguttara-nikāya* discourse continues its description of all four paths by mentioning only a *bhikkhu*. In its concluding statement about these four paths, however, the *bhikkhunīs* are mentioned again.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref53" href="#fn53">[53]</a></sup> The explanations given on each of these four paths to full awakening are of course as relevant for *bhikkhunīs* as they are for *bhikkhus*. The introductory phrase in both versions makes this quite clear. Hence the difference between the two versions, where the *Saṃyukta-āgama* discourse continues to speak throughout of “a *bhikkhu* or a *bhikkhunī* ,” whereas the *Aṅguttara-nikāya* version only speaks of “a *bhikkhu*” in its actual exposition, is a formal difference only, without deeper implications. In the *Aṅguttara-nikāya* discourse the term *bhikkhu* simply acts as an umbrella term. This exemplifies the finding of the survey of the three passages, whose variations attest to precisely this function.

## 7. What About the Term arahantī?
Another noteworthy aspect of the above presentation in the *Yuganaddha-sutta* and its *Saṃyukta-āgama* parallel is that the two versions clearly agree in including *bhikkhunīs* on a par with *bhikkhus* when it comes to making a declaration of attainment, specified in the *Aṅguttara-nikāya* discourse to be a declaration of having become an *arahant*.

The *Yuganaddha-sutta* and its *Saṃyukta-āgama* parallel do not stand alone in offering such a clear affirmation of the ability of *bhikkhunīs* to reach the highest goal. Such ability of *bhikkhunīs* to become *arahants* is a recurring topic in the early discourses. A discourse in the *Saṃyutta-nikāya* and its *Saṃyukta-āgama* parallels enunciate the basic principle that women just as well as men can reach the final goal.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref54" href="#fn54">[54]</a></sup> The same collections report the confident reply by a *bhikkhunī* to a challenge by Māra, proclaiming that gender has no say in matters of meditation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref55" href="#fn55">[55]</a></sup> This is only one in a series of discourses spoken by highly accomplished *bhikkhunīs* who self-confidently defy challenges by Māra.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref56" href="#fn56">[56]</a></sup>

The ability of women to become *arahants* also features prominently as an argument for founding an order of *bhikkhunīs* in a range of different *Vinayas* and parallel discourse versions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref57" href="#fn57">[57]</a></sup> This indication finds confirmation in the *Mahāvacchagotta-sutta* and its parallels, according to which over five hundred *bhikkhunīs* had become *arahants*.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref58" href="#fn58">[58]</a></sup> The listing of outstanding disciples in the *Aṅguttara-nikāya* and its *Ekottarika-āgama* parallel confirm the same, mentioning a considerable number of *bhikkhunīs* by name who had reached the final goal.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref59" href="#fn59">[59]</a></sup>

Some such references are only found in Pāli sources. Thus, a discourse in the *Aṅguttara-nikāya* with no known parallel reports *devas* visiting the Buddha to attest to the reaching of *arahant*-ship of certain *bhikkhunīs*, an encounter the Buddha then repeats in front of the *bhikkhus*.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref60" href="#fn60">[60]</a></sup> The *Therīgāthā* features highly accomplished *bhikkhunīs*, a particularly noteworthy example being its report of the attainment of *arahant*-ship by thirty *bhikkhunīs*.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref61" href="#fn61">[61]</a></sup> In sum, it seems clear that in early Buddhist thought the ability of *bhikkhunīs* to reach *arahant*-ship is well established and accepted.

In a paper on “Women and the Arahant Issue in Early Pali Literature,” however, Ellison Banks Findly (76) argues that women “were not granted *arahant* status by virtue of the prevailing social standards.” According to her research (58), “all the individuals to whom the term *arahant* is applied in the early Pali canon are men. There is not a single case of the term being applied definitively to a specific woman in the Vinaya (disciplinary texts) or the Nikāyas (texts of the Buddha’s sermons).” This then leads her (73) to the assumption that, even though the ability of women to reach the final goal is regularly affirmed,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref62" href="#fn62">[62]</a></sup> “women renunciants are denied designation by the title because donors are less enthusiastic about giving to *arahant* petitioners who also happen to be women.”

Now, according to a *Vinaya* rule, fully ordained monastics are prohibited from communicating their status as *arahants* to those who are not fully ordained.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref63" href="#fn63">[63]</a></sup> This makes it improbable that the term *arahant* as part of a self-declaration of attainment could have served as a marker to inspire lay donors to give offerings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref64" href="#fn64">[64]</a></sup>

Moreover, the masculine form *arahant* is also not applied in the Pāli discourses or in the *Vinaya* to Sāriputta, for example, the foremost disciple while the Buddha was alive. The same holds for Mahākassapa, just to give one more example, who took on a central role in the monastic community right after the Buddha’s demise. This does not mean that the status of being an *arahant* was denied to these two outstanding *bhikkhus* or that they were not thought to be worthy of offerings. Instead, it is simply a chance result of the fact that the status of being an *arahant* finds expression in various alternative phrases.

An expression used frequently in Pāli texts specifies *arahant* statues with the indication that the influxes (*āsava*) have been eradicated. Such a specification is indeed used in relation to Sāriputta and Mahākassapa,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref65" href="#fn65">[65]</a></sup> as well as in relation to a number of named *bhikkhunīs*.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref66" href="#fn66">[66]</a></sup> Needless to say, one who has eradicated the influxes is as worthy of offerings as anyone who is explicitly designated with the epithet *arahant*.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref67" href="#fn67">[67]</a></sup>

Contrary to the suggestion by Banks Findly, in at least one case an individual *bhikkhunī* is explicitly designated as an *arahant*, together with her son. The passage occurs in the *Vinaya* as part of the Sudinna narrative that forms the background for the promulgation of the *pārājika* regulation against sexual intercourse.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref68" href="#fn68">[68]</a></sup> The passage mentions Sudinna, his wife, and his son Bījaka, followed by indicating “at a later time the two went forth from the home to homelessness and realized *arahant*-ship.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref69" href="#fn69">[69]</a></sup>

Banks Findly (59 note 8) finds the passage ambiguous, since according to her it could intend father and son. Hence she concludes, setting aside the indications provided by Horner (34 note 1) and Malalasekera (293), that “the ambiguity of the construction precludes the definitive attribution of the title *arahant* to Bījaka’s mother.” This seems to be the result of a misunderstanding of the narrative context. Already at the time of fathering Bījaka, Sudinna had been a *bhikkhu*. Thus he had definitely gone forth from the home to homelessness a long time before his son could ever do so. As Sudinna was the *bhikkhu* responsible for occasioning a rule against sexual intercourse, he was not punished and thus was not in any need to ordain again.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref70" href="#fn70">[70]</a></sup> Therefore, the passage describing a going forth of those who then become *arahants* can only intend the mother and the son, as in fact explicitly indicated in the commentary.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a id="fnref71" href="#fn71">[71]</a></sup>

Turning to Jain texts by way of providing some contextualization in the ancient Indian setting, Roth (*Mallī-jñāta* 48) notes that, from the moment the female saint Mallī is explicitly qualified as an *arahant*, the *Nāyādhammakahāo* switches to employing masculine forms to refer to her, even though she is still a woman. Roth (*Mallī-jñāta* 139 note 92) explains that even today Jains use masculine forms when addressing a woman in order to express reverence.

In sum, the rare application of the term *arahant* to women in Pāli discourse and Vinaya literature need not be seen as an attempt to deprive fully awakened *bhikkhunīs* of their worthiness to receive offerings by faithful donors.

## Conclusion
To conclude, the paucity of examples of the term *arahantī* does not imply that the ability of women to reach full awakening was not recognized. Similarly, the use of the nominative *bhikkhu* does not reflect gender discrimination.

With regards to the vocative, *bhikkhave* appears to be an example of an idiomatic plural vocative used to convey more than its simple literal sense. By the time of the collating/composing/writing down of the extant *aṭṭhakathās* (whenever we understand that to be) the idea of the vocative address to monks as idiomatic—i.e. conveying more than the literal meaning and intending to mean “Monks and all present”—seems to have become imbricated into the tradition.

We would like to conclude with a note on the question of translation and the question: does or should the evidence and arguments presented above impact on how we translate the terms? Our answer to this is that we think it is helpful to indicate, in a publication—and especially with a publication that includes use of the terms in Pāli—the broader parameters of meaning in relation to *bhikkhave* and *bhikkhu*. To translate the terms with a purely literal meaning, just as “Monk” or “Monks,” does fail to capture the broader meaning of the terms that are revealed through detailed analysis and that were (at least) adhered to by some communities in the course of the history of Buddhist traditions. To translate the terms simply as “Monk” or “Monks” can easily lead to misunderstanding, such that the assumption is that the teaching or teachings are addresses only to the monks, or intended to be applicable only to male monastics. Yet, and this is perhaps the main point we make with this paper, early Buddhist teachings explicitly addressed to male monastics should not be interpreted to be invariably aimed solely at them.

  	Banks Findly (70) supports her argument by noting that “several times in the Theragāthā, <em>bhikkhus</em> say ‘I am an <em>arahant</em>, worthy of gifts”, followed by referring in her notes 77 and 78 to Th 296, Th 336, Th 516, to which she adds AN 4.374 and AN 5.23 as other occurrences found “elsewhere in the canon”. In view of the above mentioned <em>Vinaya</em> stipulation, however, these stanzas in the <em>Theragāthā</em> could not have been addressed to lay followers living at the same time as the <em>bhikkhus</em> who speak the respective stanza, as this would amount to presenting *arahants* as breaking a <em>pācittiya</em> rule, something that can safely be set aside as a highly improbable interpretation of these stanzas. The first of the references given to the <em>Aṅguttara-nikāya</em> appears to be wrong (4.374 must be intending volume and page, as in E e the Fours only go up to discourse number 271; AN IV 374 has no reference to worthiness of gifts at all). The other reference to the <em>Aṅguttara-nikāya</em> (AN 10.16 at AN V 23, 1 ) lists ten people worthy of gifts: a Tathāgata and nine types of disciple at various levels of progress. This passage clearly accords worthiness of gift according to spiritual progress and without introducing any gender distinction. It thus indicates the precise opposite of Banks Findly’s conclusions. Similar listings of various persons considered worthy of gifts can be found in DN 23 at DN III 253, 27 , DN 23 at DN III 255, 3 , AN 2.4 at AN I 63, 6 , AN 7.14 at AN IV 10, 21 , AN 7.16 at AN IV 13, 10 , AN 7.80 at AN IV 145, 16 , AN 8.59 at AN IV 292, 8 , AN 9.10 at AN IV 373, 1 , and Sn 227.

Clarke (192 note 99) notes that parallel passages in the Dharmaguptaka, Mahīśāsaka, Mūlasarvāstivāda, and Sarvāstivāda <em>Vinayas</em> only mention the son’s attainment of *arahant*-ship; cf.

Elsewhere, the Mūlasarvāstivāda <em>Vinaya</em>, Dutt (22, 9 ), uses the expression <em>arahantinī</em>; a usage already noted by Edgerton (67) and Finnegan (200 note 10); for a study of <em>arahatīs</em> cf. also Feer.
