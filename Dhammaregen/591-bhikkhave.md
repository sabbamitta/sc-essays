### Abstract
In what follows we examine whether the use of the vocative *bhikkhave* or the nominative *bhikkhu* in Buddhist canonical texts imply that female monastics are being excluded from the audience. In the course of exploring this basic point, we also take up the vocative of proper names and the absence of the term *arahantī* in Pāli discourse literature. \*2

### Introduction
The terms *bhikkhave* and *bhikkhu*, and particularly their appearance in Pāli Buddhist literature appear, on the surface, to be terminology that excludes women. The vocative address to monks (*bhikkhave* and its equivalents) that occurs so often in *sutta* literature appears to be indi- cating that the teachings being proffered are addressed exclusively to male monastics. Similarly, the use of the normative *bhikkhu* (and its equivalents), in expositions relating to the teaching, again appears to indicate that monks are the sole and only concern of those offering the teaching. However, in both cases, such an understanding of each term is problematic.

In this article, we discuss each of these terms, and look a little more closely at each, suggesting that in fact neither term should be con- sidered to be exclusive language; that is to say, in neither case do the terms function as indicators that the address or the detail of the teaching is solely for monks. The term *bhikkhave* should be considered instead to be a form of—what we are calling—an idiomatic plural vocative; that is, a vocative that is intended to capture a broader audience than is implied by the actual term itself. Similarly, *bhikkhu* is intended as an umbrella nominative, to mean “monk or nun” and sometimes as well “laity” and should be read as generic. We first discuss the term *bhikkhave*, then *bhikkhu*, and following that we also include a note on the term *arhantī*.

### 1. *Bhikkhave* in Pāli
The vocative address to monks appears in two ways in the Pāli canon—*bhikkhave* and *bhikkhavo*, with *bhikkhave* being the most common form. \*3 Past scholars, such as Bechert, developed theories in relation to the use of the two, i.e. why one form rather than another was used—but today, with our current understanding of oral and manuscript traditions, the most obvious reason for the two ways of declining the plural vocative is simply that the texts that comprise the Pāli canon are layered texts that came into their extant form over time. \*4 

The following is a typical example of how the vocative address appears, from the *Samyutta-nikāya*:
> Bhikkhus, whatever is not yours, abandon it. When you have abandoned it, that will lead to your welfare and happiness. And what is it, Bhikkhus, that is not yours? Bhikkhus, form is not yours: abandon it. When you have abandoned it, that will lead to your welfare and happiness … \*5

This is how it appears in the majority of texts of the Pāli canon, although not in the versified texts such as the *Dhammapada*, *Theratherīgāthā* and *Sutta-nipāta*. This translation is Bhikkhu Bodhi’s translation, but with all instances of the vocative reinstated. The term appears much more often than Bhikkhu Bodhi translates it. For example on the *Ariyapariyesanā-sutta* of the *Majjhima-nikāya*, Bhikkhu Bodhi translates it only twelve times, whereas it appears in the *sutta* in the extant PTS Pāli edition 121 times. Also, in the *Sakka-saṃyutta* of the *Saṃyutta-nikāya*, it appears 105 number of times in the PTS edition, but only sixty times in Bhikkhu Bodhi’s translation.

If we compare these numbers with some parallel *suttas* from other traditions, some of the differences in number are striking. In the *Sakka-saṃyutta* parallel in the shorter Saṃyukta-āgama, translated by Marcus Bingenheimer, the term appears only eight times, compared to 105 in the PTS edition. In the (first half of the) *Ariyapariyesanā-sutta* parallel in the Chinese *Madhyama-āgama*, translated by Anālayo (“Brahmā’s”), the term appears only twice, compared to 121 times in the full PTS edition.

However, the differences are not always so great. In the *Māra-saṃyukta* from the shorter *Saṃyukta-āgama*, the term does not appear at all, and in the Pāli only seventeen times, as many of the sections are just the Buddha and Māra in dialogue. Similarly, in other *suttas* in which the Buddha dialogues with just one or two people, or groups who are not his followers, there are no occurrences of the term in either the Pāli or Chinese. \*6

In Gāndhārī parallels of fragments of some *suttas* the vocative address is sometimes missing, even if the parallel is otherwise exact. This is most evident in Glass’s study of four *Saṃyukta-āgama sūtras*. There are seven instances for comparison. Of these, on four occasions the Pāli has the vocative address, whilst the Gāndhārī does not. On two occasions both have the vocative address, and on the other occasion, the Pāli has *bhikkhave* three times whilst in the Gāndhārī the equivalent—*bhikṣave*—occurs only once. The last instance is as follows:
> Pāli—*yam **bhikkhave** na tumhākaṃ tam pajahatha. Taṃ vo pahīnaṃ hitāya sukhāya bhavissati. Kiñca **bhikkave** na tumhākam. Rūpam **bhikkave** na tumhākaṃ tam pajahatha.*
> 
> Gāndhārī (Reconstructed)—*ya **bhikṣave** ṇa tuspahu ta praca{ja}asa ta prahiṇa hiḏae suhae bhavi(*śaḏi kica ṇa) (*tuspahu)u ruo ṇa tuspahu ta pajaasa …* (Glass 178)

The other four examples with the missing vocative are as follows:
> Pāli—*seyyathāpi **bhikkhave** yam imasmiṃ jetavane tiṇakaṭṭhasākhāpalāsam taṃ jano hareyya vā ḍaheyya vā yathāpaccayaṃ vā kareyya.*
>
> Gāndhārī (Reconstructed) - *sayasavi yo himaspi jeḏavaṇe triṇa-kaṭha-śaha-patra-palaśa ta jaṇe chidea va harea v(*a dahea ve yasapa)c(*e)a karea …* (Glass 180)
>
> Pāli—*evam eva kho bhikkave rūpaṃ na tumhākam.*
>
> Gāndhārī (Reconstructed)—*evam eva ya ṇa tuspahu …* (Glass 183)
>
> Pāli—*bhāvanānuyogaṃ ananuyuttassa bhikkhave bhikkhuno viharato …*
>
> Gāndhārī (Reconstructed)—*bhavaṇaṇuyoḵa aṇaṇuyutasa bhikhusa viharaḏe …* (Glass 205)
>
> Pāli—*seyyathāpi bhikkhave kukkuṭiyā aṇḍāni aṭṭha vā dasa vā dvádasa vā …*
>
> Gāndhārī (Reconstructed)—*saysavi kukuḍ(*ia aḍagaṇi a)ṭh(*a) va daśa va baḏaśa va …* (Glass 207)

All these examples are from the *Saṃyukta-āgama*, as many of the other Gāndhārī fragments are from texts that do not contain the vocative address—such as the *Dhammapada*, or of texts with no direct Pāli equivalent. Mark Allon’s survey of the three *Ekottarika-āgama*-type *sūtras* does not afford good comparison, as unfortunately most often the vocatives, if they had been there, would have come at the left hand side of the line, which is missing in the fragments. Allon has reconstructed the lines with the vocative address as it is in parallel Pāli passages, but it is unclear from the manuscript fragments as to whether it was there on the complete manuscript or not.

### 2. Mahāsāṅghika-Lokottaravāda *Bhikṣuṇī Vinaya*
In the Pāli *Vinaya* the vocative address appears often, even in the nuns’ section—and in discussing this we touch on observations made previously by Anālayo (“Theories”) and von Hinüber (“Foundation”). In the nuns’ section, when an event happens the nuns tell the monks, who tell the Buddha and then the Buddha makes a ruling for the nuns, but uses the vocative *bhikkhave*. If we understand the use of the term here in its most literal sense, then the Buddha seems to be instructing the monks about rules for nuns.

In sharp contrast to the vocative address featuring extensively in the nuns’ section of the Pāli *Vinaya*, it is absent from the Mahāsāṅghika-Lokottaravāda *Bhikṣuṇī Vinaya*. The Mahāsāṅghika-Lokottaravāda *Bhikṣuṇī Vinaya* begins with the Buddha instructing Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī to gather together the community of nuns and once she has done so he will give the teaching of the rules. Also, in relation to the individual rules, after events have happened and Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī has explained the situation to the Buddha, the Buddha instructs her to gather together the nuns (even those who may have heard the ruling before) so that he can pronounce the ruling. In this case, then, as stipulated, the audience for both the entire exposition and individual rules is entirely female and monastic.

In this text, I found no examples of the vocative address to monks, nor was there the female equivalent. Instead, when the Buddha does address the collected assembly with a particular term, he addresses them as one assembly—the terms used are either *āryamiśrikā*, *āryamiśrā* or *āryā saṅgho*,—that is the Buddha addresses the collective as “Assembly of Venerable Nuns” or “Community of Venerable Nuns.” \*7 However, in the majority of the time, no vocatives are used, and the Buddha simply pronounces a rule, with the preface of “*bhagavān āha*.”
> *yāciṣyati āryamiśrā* … —it is said, Assembly of Venerable Nuns … (Roth *Bhikṣuṇī-Vinaya* 240)
>
> *ṣrṇotu me āryā saṃgho* … —Listen to me, Community of Venerable Nuns … (Roth *Bhikṣuṇī-Vinaya* 241 (twice) and 243)

The Buddha addresses the entire assembly as a collective, and does not pick out seniors amongst them to address, even though it is clear throughout the Mahāsāṅghika-Lokottaravāda *Bhikṣuṇī Vinaya* that Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī is considered the most senior of the nuns.

### 3. Idiomatic Vocative of Proper Names in the Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivāda *Vinaya* and in Pāli Texts
Contrary to the case of the Mahāsāṅghika-Lokottaravāda *Bhikṣuṇī Vinaya*, in the Mūlasarvāstivāda *Vinaya* preserved in Tibetan translation the Buddha uses the idiomatic plural vocative of the name of Gautamī. The episode in question reports how five hundred *bhikṣuṇīs*, who are followers of Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī, ask the Buddha to allow them to enter Nirvāṇa before he passes away. He replies:
> Gautamīs, for what reason do you say you [wish to enter] Nirvāṇa? \*8

A comparable pattern can be seen in several Pāli discourses, where the Buddha uses the expression *vo ānanda*, used by the Buddha when giving a teaching in the presence of his chief attendant. \*9 The pronoun *vo*, the enclitic of *tumhe*, corresponds to the plural “you.” In this way, the combination of the plural “you” with the singular name Ānanda indicates that the teaching was addressed to the Buddha’s attendant and at the same time to whoever else happened to form the audience for that particular teaching.

When the construction *vo* followed by a proper name is used for someone who represents a specific group, the proper name itself can also take the plural form, similar to the Mūlasarvāstivāda *Vinaya* passage mentioned above. This is the case for Anuruddha on occasions when he is addressed together with his close companions. Here is one such passage from the *Naḷakapāna-sutta*, which reports the Buddha deciding to ask a question of Anuruddha and his companions: \*10
> Then the Blessed One had this thought: “What if I now question those clansmen?” Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Anuruddha: “Anuruddhas, do you (plural) delight in the holy life?”

The same type of usage can also be found in the *Cūḷagosinga-sutta* and the *Upakkilesa-sutta*. Each of these two discourses reports the Buddha addressing Anuruddha and his companions Nandiya and Kimbila with the plural form *anuruddhā*, “Anuruddhas.” \*11 This form of address is clearly not meant to exclude the other two.

The same type of usage recurs in relation to Sāriputta in the Pāli *Vinaya*, taking the form *sāriputtā*. In what follows I translate two examples. The first concerns the need to deal with the misbehavior of the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka, on being informed of which the Buddha addresses Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna: \*12
> [The Blessed One] addressed Sāriputta and [Mahā]moggallāna: “Sāriputtas, you (plural) go and, having gone to Kīṭāgiri, carry out an act of banishment from Kīṭāgiri against the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka.”

The second instance is related to Devadatta. The Buddha has just been informed that the schismatic Devadatta has gathered a substantial following of *bhikkhus*, whereupon the Buddha asks Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna to bring these *bhikkhus* back: \*13
> “Sāriputtas, would you (plural) not have compassion for those newly ordained monks? Sāriputtas, you (plural) go, before those monks fall into trouble and misfortune.” Having heard the Blessed One, Sāriputta and [Mahā]moggallāna [said]: “Very well, venerable sir.”

Clearly in this instance, too, the proper name of a single person is used in the plural form to express that the form of address is not meant in an exclusive manner. \*14 The choice of Sāriputta over Mahāmoggallāna reflects the fact that Sāriputta was considered the chief disciple of the Buddha and thus more prominent than other eminent disciples. \*15 In this way, a group of two or more can be referred to by using a plural form of the name of the most eminent member of the group.

The case of Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna also shows that such usage need not be discriminatory. The fact that Mahāmoggallāna is not explicitly mentioned does not imply that the Buddha favored Sāriputta over Mahāmoggallāna, or that Mahāmoggallāna’s abilities did not receive their deserved recognition and he was slighted at the expense of Sāriputta. Instead, it only reflects the fact that, by directly addressing those higher in the hierarchy, those not explicitly mentioned are also included.

### 4. Idiomatic Vocative in Other Sources
The cases above clearly demonstrate the use of the idiomatic vocative in Pāli and indicates at least one use of it in Tibetan. In texts in other Indic languages, the usage is less clear. For instance, in the Gāndhārī fragments of the *Cūḷagosiṅga-sutta*, the name Anuruddha (G. Aṇarudha) is not obviously in the plural, although a plural may be intended. \*16

However, there is an example of the idiomatic vocative in the Sanskrit Mūlasarvāstivāda *Vinaya*. In the opening section of Gnoli’s edited text of the *Saṅghabhedavastu*, a group of Śākyans desiring to know the origins of their clan approaches the Buddha to request he narrate this. The Buddha instructs Maudgalyāyana to do the honors. When Maudgalyāyana sits down to begin his narration, he addresses the gathered Śākyans as “Gautamā”—that is, he addresses them with a plural vocative. In this instance, it appears that plural vocative is being used as the name of the principal family of the group, rather than an individual, as in the examples above. Gautama is, of course, the personal name of the Buddha, but in this instance the Buddha sits (both metaphorically and literally) outside of the group being addressed. The vocative here is used again idiomatically, in a hierarchical formulation, whereby the principal group in an assembly is addressed by name, but the address is an address to the entire group. Here is the text:
> The Buddha, the Blessed One, was staying in Kapilavastu, in the Nyagrodha Park. At that time, many Śākyans of Kapilavastu were gathered together in one house, and amongst them a discussion of this sort arose: “What is the origin of the Śākyans? Who were the first, who followed, and who amongst the Śākyans are the oldest family lineage?” … Then the many Śākyans of Kapilavastu approached the Buddha [and put the question to him] … Then the Blessed One said to Venerable Maudgalyāyana: “Tell them, Venerable Maudgalyāyana, [begin] the lineage of the ancient Śākyan family …” … having sat down, Maudgalyāyana addressed the Śākyans of Kapilavastu: “It was, Gautamās, during this time when this earth was coming into being …” (Gnoli 5-7)

As this instance is concerned with family and clan, it raises the question as to whether this use of the vocative is attested in contemporaneous Brahmanical literature. There is, as far as I know, no evidence of this idiomatic use of the vocative in such literature. \*17

In discussing the matter with Simon Brodbeck, he pointed out that in the *Mahābhārata*, in instances in which the five Pāṇḍavas and Draupadī are conversing with some teacher or another, usually Yudhiṣṭhira will do the talking, and the interlocutor will then address Yudhiṣṭhira by way of a singular vocative in reply, even though the address is meant for all present.

Examples of this can be found in, for instance the *Vanaparvan*, the *Śāntiparvan*, and the *Anuśāsanaparvan*. In one example in the *Vanaparvan*, Yudhiṣṭhira asks sage Mārkaṇḍeya if he has ever known a woman as pure and virtuous as Draupadī, and when Mārkaṇḍeya replies with a story of such a woman, he begins his narrative “Listen, King Yudhiṣṭhira …” (*śṛṇu rājan … yudhiṣṭhira* Mbh 3.293.4) although his story is intended for all the five brothers present. \*18 Then, at the conclusion of the *Āraṇyakaparvan*, the five brothers ask a question of the sages, who reply reminding them of edifying tales of others who have suffered similarly to themselves. This is clearly intended for all the brothers, but again addressed to Yudhiṣṭhira alone (with the vocative *rājan* Mbh 3.315.11). These examples do not mirror the examples above from Buddhist texts. A replica of the Anuruddha example (for instance) in these cases would entail the name Yudhiṣṭhira in the plural not singular.

Similarly, in Jain texts there is no evidence of an idiomatic plural vocative used in this way. \*19 In Jain texts I have consulted, there is usually just an imperative such as “Listen to me” or “Look” or “See” where we might find *bhikkhave* in the Pāli, and no similar vocative used. So, it does appear that this usage is specific of Buddhist texts. \*20

In addition to the usage we have been able to identify being confined to Buddhist texts, the instances in which these plural vocatives appear can be considered quite particular, and their particularity may be an indication of how this idiomatic use of the vocative began to develop in early Indian Buddhist communities.

In the Sanskrit Mūlasarvāstivāda *Vinaya*, the idiomatic plural vocative is used in a narrative about the origins of the Śākyan clan, and the Gautama family, for the Śākyans are immensely important. The *Upakkilesa-sutta*, with Anuruddha, is well known as one of the best examples of how followers of the Buddha can live together in perfect harmony. Further, Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna are well known to be close companions. In each of these cases, the relationships between members of the groups or the pair in question are either very close ones, or particularly significant ones. These examples, together with a lack of equivalents in contemporaneous religious literature, suggest a burgeoning development of this type of mode of address in some early Indian Buddhist communities, perhaps used as an indicator of significant relationships between members of a group or pairs of individuals.

### 5. *Aṭṭhakathā* Exegesis
The Pāli commentarial tradition provides glosses on the term *bhikkhave*. These confirm our argument in relation to the idiomatic use of the vocative. For instance, the types of short exegesis of the term often found in the *aṭṭhakathās* are as follows:
> ***bhikkhave** ti paṭissavena abhimukhībhūtānaṃ puna ālapanaṃ.* \*21
>
> ***bhikkhave** ti yo koci bhikkhu vā bhikkhunī vā upāsako vā upāsikā vā.* \*22
>
> ***bhikkhū āmantesī** ti parisa-jeṭṭhake bhikkhū jānāpesi. **Bhikkhavo** ti tesaṃ āmantaṇ’ ākāra-dīpanaṃ.* \*23

These three examples—with *bhikkhave* and *bhikkhavo*—show the range of exegesis: the vocative address *bhikkhave/ bhikkhavo* can refer to all those gathered who show reverence, or it can mean one who is a monk, nun, layman or laywomen, or it can be said, more specifically, to be an address to the elder monks in the community. And with regards to this last comment, there are longer sections of exegesis of *bhikkhave*, such as a passage repeated in the commentaries on the first occurrence of the term in the *Majjhima-nikāya*, the *Saṃyutta-nikāya* and the *Aṅguttara-nikāya*. The passage states that while the literal address is to the senior monks, it is not intended as exclusive. Firstly, *bhikkhavo* is said to refer those who are fit to hear the discourse—
> ***Bhikkhavo*** explaining the address—said to be those who are capable and able in the group, starting with those with the character of mendicant. \*24

Following this, the text of the *aṭṭhakathās* then asks—But other men and gods are present, why are only monks addressed? \*25 And the reply is as follows:
> The elders and best are nearest, because they are always close. But the *dhamma* teaching of the Blessed One is applicable to all in the assembly, and in the assembly, the elder monks have become foremost; the excellent ones, living the homeless life, etc., they follow the way of the
teacher and themselves grasped the entire dispensation. \*26

And with regards to those who have the privilege of being close to the teacher, the passage continues:
> Those who are near, sat there, they are in the presence of the teacher, always close, they are companions of the teacher. And also, just as they are instructed in this portion of *dhamma* teaching, it is said, honoring this method, they are addressed similarly [elsewhere]. \*27

Here the *aṭṭhakathās* gloss the vocative address as idiomatic, as we have been discussing. The Buddha addresses the monks, or the elder monks, who sit closest to him, but he is talking to all those who are gathered. And, as the last quoted passage says, this is how the Buddha’s disciples are instructed in this case, and it is usually this way.

### 6. The Use of the Nominatives *bhikkhu* and *bhikkhunī*
In addition to the case of the vocative *bhikkhave*, discussed so far, in what follows I take up the use of the nominative *bhikkhu* and/or *bhikkhunī* based on three examples. The first example comes in a discourse on *bhikkhunīs* in the *Saṃyutta-nikāya* and its *Saṃyukta-āgama* parallel, which throw into relief the expertise of a group of *bhikkhunīs* in their *satipaṭṭhāna* practice. The other two examples are from the *Majjhima-nikāya* and the *Aṅguttara-nikāya*, namely the *Cetokhila-sutta* and the *Yuganaddha-sutta* (together with their parallels), to which I will turn subsequently. \*28 I begin by translating the first part of the discourse on *bhikkhunīs* in the *Saṃyukta-āgama*: \*29
> [Discourse on *bhikkhunīs*] \*30
>
> Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.
>
> At that time the venerable Ānanda put on his robes in the morning and took his bowl to enter the town of Sāvatthī to beg alms. On the way he thought: “Let me now first go to the monastic dwelling (*vihāra*) of the *bhikkhunīs*.” He promptly went to the monastic dwelling of the *bhikkhunīs*. \*31
>
> On seeing from afar that the venerable Ānanda was coming, the *bhikkhunīs* swiftly prepared a seat and invited him to sit down. \*32 Then the *bhikkhunīs* paid respect at the feet of the venerable Ānanda, withdrew to sit to one side, and said to the venerable Ānanda: “We *bhikkhunīs* are established in cultivating the four establishments of mindfulness with a [well] collected mind, and we ourselves know successively more or less [lofty stages].” \*33
>
> The venerable Ānanda said to the *bhikkhunīs*: “It is well, it is well, Sisters, one should train as you have described. One who is established in cultivating all four establishments of mindfulness with a well collected mind should in this way know successively more or less [lofty stages].” \*34 Then the venerable Ānanda taught the Dharma in various ways to the *bhikkhunīs*. Having taught the Dharma in various ways, he rose from his seat and left.
>
> At that time, after having returned from begging alms in Sāvatthī, having stored away his robe and bowl, and having washed his feet, the venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One. He paid respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet, withdrew to sit to one side, and fully told the Blessed One what the *bhikkhunīs* had said. \*35

Ānanda’s report of the way of practice of the *bhikkhunīs* meets with the Buddha’s approval, who then takes this as the occasion for delivering a talk on such practice. The talk proceeds in this way: \*36
> “Suppose a *bhikkhu* is established in mindfully contemplating the body as a body. \*37 Having become established in mindfully contemplating the body as a body, suppose the body is affected by drowsiness and the mental factors are sluggish. \*38 That *bhikkhu* should arouse inspired confidence by taking hold of an inspiring sign. \*39
>
> “Having aroused a mental state of inspired confidence by recollecting an inspiring sign, his mind becomes delighted. [His mind] having become delighted, joy arises. His mind having become joyous, his body becomes tranquil. His body having become tranquil, he experiences happiness with his whole being. \*40 Having experienced happiness with his whole being, his mind becomes concentrated.”

Even though the first half of the discourse is concerned with the *satipaṭṭhāna* practice undertaken by *bhikkhunīs*, on being informed about this the Buddha describes *satipaṭṭhāna* practice of *bhikkhus*, without mentioning *bhikkhunīs* at all. The same is the case for the *Saṃyutta-nikāya* parallel. \*41 This raises the question if the shift from *bhikkhunīs* to *bhikkhus* is an expression of gender prejudice, in the sense that the actual practice of the *bhikkhunīs* does not receive the recognition it deserves. To explore this further, I turn to the second of the three passages mentioned earlier.

This second passage occurs in the *Cetokhila-sutta*, a discourse found in the *Majjhima-nikāya* as well as in the *Aṅguttara-nikāya*, with parallels in the *Madhyama-āgama* and the *Ekottarika-āgama*. In all versions the Buddha begins a sermon by highlighting the need to overcome two sets of five mental obstructions. I begin with a translation of the *Madhyama-āgama* version: \*42
> “If a *bhikkhu* or a *bhikkhunī* has not uprooted five mental defilements and has not become free from five mental bondages, I say that *bhikkhu* or *bhikkhunī* will certainly decline in the Dharma. What are the five mental defilements that have not been uprooted? Suppose someone has doubt about the Blessed One and is hesitant …”

This presentation appears unproblematic from a gender perspective. The passage sets out by mentioning defilements and bondages that would affect *bhikkhus* just as well as *bhikkhunīs*, and then continues to expound the first of these defilements, doubt about the Buddha, by simply speaking of “someone.” The same is not the case for the *Ekottarika-āgama* version, which reads as follows: \*43

> “If a *bhikkhu* or a *bhikkhunī* has not eradicated five mental maladies and has not gotten rid of five mental bondages, that *bhikkhu* or *bhikkhunī* day and night will decline and not grow in wholesome states. What are the five mental maladies that have not been eradicated? In this way a *bhikkhu* has doubt in his mind in relation to the Tathāgata …”

In the Ekottarika-āgama version the passage also sets out by men-
tioning a problem that can affect bhikkhus just as well as bhikkhunīs. But
when it comes to the actual exposition, it only envisages a bhikkhu hav-
ing doubt about the Buddha. 44 The same pattern holds for the rest of the
Ekottarika-āgama discourse, where in the case of each mental obstruction
only a bhikkhu is mentioned.
On a literal reading of the Ekottarika-āgama exposition, one would
have to conclude that it considers mental obstructions to be occurring
only in the case of bhikkhus. Since bhikkhunīs are not mentioned, it would
follow that from the perspective of this discourse they do not experience
doubt about the Buddha or any other of the mental maladies and mental
bondages discussed in the discourse.
Such a reading is of course made impossible by the introductory
phrase, which explicitly states that these two sets of five obstructions
need to be overcome by both bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs, not only by bhik-
khus.
The passage might at first sight appear ambiguous, since the occurrence of 比丘
could in principle also be rendering a vocative bhikkhave, as a result of which the dis-
course would then not specify the gender of the one who has doubt. This seems to me
to be an improbable reading, however, since the preceding part does not employ any
vocative and the Buddha begins directly with the phrase “If a bhikkhu or a bhikkhunī . . .”
This makes it safe to conclude that in the present case the occurrence of 比丘 does not
render a vocative bhikkhave, but rather the nominative bhikkhu.

Journal of Buddhist Ethics
A similar contrast between the introductory statement and the
body of the exposition can also be seen in the Aṅguttara-nikāya version,
where the relevant passage proceeds in this way: 45
“Bhikkhus, whatever bhikkhu or bhikkhunī has not aban-
doned the five kinds of mental barrenness and not cut off
the five bondages of the mind, of him deterioration in
wholesome states is to be expected, come day, come night,
not growth. What are the five kinds of mental barrenness
that he has not abandoned? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has
doubt about the teacher and hesitation . . .”
In this passage the use of the masculine singular genitive tassa,
which I have translated “of him,” is already found in the introductory
phrase. This is so even though it follows a reference to a bhikkhu or a
bhikkhunī, a shift confirmed by the use of only the term bhikkhu when it
comes to expounding the first mental barrenness. On adopting a prima
facie reading in the case of this presentation, one would have to con-
clude not only that bhikkhus stand alone in having doubt, but it is also
only for bhikkhus that doubt and the other mental obstructions lead to
deterioration instead of growth. Clearly, such a reading fails to make
sense.
Besides the Aṅguttara-nikāya discourse, another version of the
same discourse can be found in the Majjhima-nikāya of the same Pāli can-
on, and this version shows a significant difference. The relevant part
reads as follows: 46
“Bhikkhus, whatever bhikkhu has not abandoned the five
kinds of mental barrenness and not cut off the five bond-

ages of the mind, that he should come to prosperity,
growth, and abundance in this Dharma and discipline,
that is impossible. What are the five kinds of mental bar-
renness that he has not abandoned? Here, bhikkhus, a
bhikkhu has doubt about the teacher and hesitation . . .”
So here the bhikkhunīs are not mentioned at all, right from the
outset. Had this discourse been from a different reciter tradition, one
might even wonder if this expresses an even stronger gender bias, in the
sense of discrimination against male monastics. It consistently takes up
only the case of bhikkhus having these mental obstructions and does not
envisage at all that bhikkhunīs could have any relation to these.
The fact that this discourse is part of the same oral transmission
of Pāli discourses by Theravāda reciters as the Aṅguttara-nikāya version
that does mention bhikkhunīs points of course in a different direction.
The solution to the conundrum posed by the examples surveyed so far is
simply that the term bhikkhu does not automatically restrict an exposi-
tion to male monastics alone, but can rather act as an umbrella term that
includes bhikkhunīs as well as sāmaṇeras, sikkhamānās, and sāmaṇerīs, in
short, all monastics independent of their gender or level of ordination. 47
In fact at times the usage of bhikkhu may not even intend to refer only to
monastics, but may also include laity. 48 Thus it would not be correct to
A similar conclusion has recently been suggested by Ānandajoti (4), as in MN 146 at
MN III 275, 26 a teaching given to bhikkhunīs on the development of insight describes the
cultivation of the awakening factors by a bhikkhu only, making it clear that “here the
word bhikkhu must include the nuns he is addressing and encouraging with the
Dhamma talk, therefore . . . when bhikkhu is said in the discourses it should be taken as
referring to both male and female renunciants, and . . . a more appropriate term for
translation than monk would be monastic, unless we specifically know that the nuns are
absent.”

assume that, e.g., because the instructions in the Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta are
addressed to bhikkhus, it follows that during the early period of Bud-
dhism only monks were expected to engage in mindfulness practice. 49
The functioning of bhikkhu as an umbrella term can also be seen
from the third passage to be examined, which occurs in the Yuganaddha-
sutta and its Saṃyukta-āgama parallel. In both versions Ānanda is the
speaker. Here comes an extract from the Saṃyukta-āgama version. 50
“If a bhikkhu or a bhikkhunī declare themselves in front of
me, I will approve and rejoice, and then inquire which of
these four paths they pursued. What are the four?
“Suppose a bhikkhu or a bhikkhunī while sitting [in medita-
tion] in this way settle the mind, well settle the mind, def-
initely settle the mind, and train the mind in tranquility
and insight . . .”
The discourse continues with more details on this particular path
and then describes another three paths adopted by “bhikkhus or bhik-
Pace Wilson (71 and 21), who comments that “the Satipatthana Sutta and the other
main mindfulness sources of the Pali Canon are notably male: delivered by a male Bud-
dha to male monastics” . . . “in this classic presentation mindfulness is taught to monks,
not the general Buddhist community.” That lay practice of mindfulness is not just a
recent phenomena could be seen, for example, in MN 51 at MN I 340, 13 , where a lay
disciple describes his satipaṭṭhāna practice in front of the Buddha as being undertaken
with a “well established mind,” supaṭṭhitacitta, an expression that points to a considera-
ble degree of proficiency in such practice. Other examples would be SN 47.29 at SN V
177, 18 and SN 47.30 at SN V 178, 6 , which feature lay practitioners of the four satipaṭ-
ṭhānas, the same is also reported in a parallel to SN 47.30, SĀ 1038 at T II 271a 17 . I al-
ready drew attention to these Pāli discourses and to the fact that satipaṭṭhāna instruc-
tions were not meant to exclude laity, a position confirmed in the commentary Ps I
241, 2 , in Anālayo (Satipaṭṭhāna 275f).

khunīs” who declare themselves in front of Ānanda, that is, who in his
presence proclaim to have reached awakening. The corresponding expo-
sition in the Aṅguttara-nikāya parallel reads as follows: 51
“Friends, whatever bhikkhu or bhikkhunī declares to have
reached arahant-ship in my presence, they all do so by
these four paths, 52 or by a certain one among them. What
are the four? Here, friends, a bhikkhu cultivates insight
preceded by tranquility . . .”
The Aṅguttara-nikāya discourse continues its description of all
four paths by mentioning only a bhikkhu. In its concluding statement
about these four paths, however, the bhikkhunīs are mentioned again. 53
The explanations given on each of these four paths to full awakening are
of course as relevant for bhikkhunīs as they are for bhikkhus. The intro-
ductory phrase in both versions makes this quite clear. Hence the differ-
ence between the two versions, where the Saṃyukta-āgama discourse
continues to speak throughout of “a bhikkhu or a bhikkhunī ,” whereas the
Aṅguttara-nikāya version only speaks of “a bhikkhu” in its actual exposi-
tion, is a formal difference only, without deeper implications. In the
Aṅguttara-nikāya discourse the term bhikkhu simply acts as an umbrella
term. This exemplifies the finding of the survey of the three passages,
whose variations attest to precisely this function.

7. What About the Term arahantī?
Another noteworthy aspect of the above presentation in the Yuganaddha-
sutta and its Saṃyukta-āgama parallel is that the two versions clearly
agree in including bhikkhunīs on a par with bhikkhus when it comes to
making a declaration of attainment, specified in the Aṅguttara-nikāya dis-
course to be a declaration of having become an arahant.
The Yuganaddha-sutta and its Saṃyukta-āgama parallel do not
stand alone in offering such a clear affirmation of the ability of bhikkhu-
nīs to reach the highest goal. Such ability of bhikkhunīs to become ara-
hants is a recurring topic in the early discourses. A discourse in the Saṃ-
yutta-nikāya and its Saṃyukta-āgama parallels enunciate the basic princi-
ple that women just as well as men can reach the final goal. 54 The same
collections report the confident reply by a bhikkhunī to a challenge by
Māra, proclaiming that gender has no say in matters of meditation. 55
This is only one in a series of discourses spoken by highly accomplished
bhikkhunīs who self-confidently defy challenges by Māra. 56
The ability of women to become arahants also features promi-
nently as an argument for founding an order of bhikkhunīs in a range of
different Vinayas and parallel discourse versions. 57 This indication finds

confirmation in the Mahāvacchagotta-sutta and its parallels, according to
which over five hundred bhikkhunīs had become arahants. 58 The listing of
outstanding disciples in the Aṅguttara-nikāya and its Ekottarika-āgama
parallel confirm the same, mentioning a considerable number of bhik-
khunīs by name who had reached the final goal. 59
Some such references are only found in Pāli sources. Thus, a dis-
course in the Aṅguttara-nikāya with no known parallel reports devas vis-
iting the Buddha to attest to the reaching of arahant-ship of certain bhik-
khunīs, an encounter the Buddha then repeats in front of the bhikkhus. 60
The Therīgāthā features highly accomplished bhikkhunīs, a particularly
noteworthy example being its report of the attainment of arahant-ship
by thirty bhikkhunīs. 61 In sum, it seems clear that in early Buddhist
thought the ability of bhikkhunīs to reach arahant-ship is well established
and accepted.
In a paper on “Women and the Arahant Issue in Early Pali Litera-
ture,” however, Ellison Banks Findly (76) argues that women “were not
granted arahant status by virtue of the prevailing social standards.” Ac-
cording to her research (58), “all the individuals to whom the term ara-
hant is applied in the early Pali canon are men. There is not a single case
of the term being applied definitively to a specific woman in the Vinaya
(disciplinary texts) or the Nikāyas (texts of the Buddha’s sermons).” This
then leads her (73) to the assumption that, even though the ability of

women to reach the final goal is regularly affirmed, 62 “women renunci-
ants are denied designation by the title because donors are less enthusi-
astic about giving to arahant petitioners who also happen to be women.”
Now, according to a Vinaya rule, fully ordained monastics are pro-
hibited from communicating their status as arahants to those who are
not fully ordained. 63 This makes it improbable that the term arahant as
part of a self-declaration of attainment could have served as a marker to
inspire lay donors to give offerings. 64
Banks Findly (68f) surveys several instances where individual bhikkhunīs are shown to
have reached the final goal in terms other than using the epithet arahant and also men-
tions some passages that affirm the ability of women in general. The inclusion of the
last of these references, Ud 7.10 at Ud 79, 20 , appears to be based on a misunderstanding,
however, since it only concerns various levels of realization up to non-return reached
by lay women, not the attainment of arahant-ship; on laity and the attainment of ara-
hant-ship cf. in more detail Anālayo (“Structural” 61f note 2).
62
This is pācittiya 8 in Vin IV 25, 22 , concerned with announcing uttarimanussadhamma to
someone who has not received higher ordination; for a comparative study of the paral-
lels in the Vinayas of other schools cf. Pachow (124f) and on the expression uttarimanus-
sadhamma cf. Anālayo (“Uttarimanussadhamma”).
63
Banks Findly (70) supports her argument by noting that “several times in the
Theragāthā, bhikkhus say ‘I am an arahant, worthy of gifts”, followed by referring in her
notes 77 and 78 to Th 296, Th 336, Th 516, to which she adds AN 4.374 and AN 5.23 as
other occurrences found “elsewhere in the canon”. In view of the above mentioned
Vinaya stipulation, however, these stanzas in the Theragāthā could not have been ad-
dressed to lay followers living at the same time as the bhikkhus who speak the respec-
tive stanza, as this would amount to presenting arahants as breaking a pācittiya rule,
something that can safely be set aside as a highly improbable interpretation of these
stanzas. The first of the references given to the Aṅguttara-nikāya appears to be wrong
(4.374 must be intending volume and page, as in E e the Fours only go up to discourse
number 271; AN IV 374 has no reference to worthiness of gifts at all). The other refer-
ence to the Aṅguttara-nikāya (AN 10.16 at AN V 23, 1 ) lists ten people worthy of gifts: a
Tathāgata and nine types of disciple at various levels of progress. This passage clearly
accords worthiness of gift according to spiritual progress and without introducing any
64Collett and Anālayo, Bhikkhave and Bhikkhu in Early Buddhist Texts
788
Moreover, the masculine form arahant is also not applied in the
Pāli discourses or in the Vinaya to Sāriputta, for example, the foremost
disciple while the Buddha was alive. The same holds for Mahākassapa,
just to give one more example, who took on a central role in the monas-
tic community right after the Buddha’s demise. This does not mean that
the status of being an arahant was denied to these two outstanding bhik-
khus or that they were not thought to be worthy of offerings. Instead, it
is simply a chance result of the fact that the status of being an arahant
finds expression in various alternative phrases.
An expression used frequently in Pāli texts specifies arahant stat-
ues with the indication that the influxes (āsava) have been eradicated.
Such a specification is indeed used in relation to Sāriputta and Mahākas-
sapa, 65 as well as in relation to a number of named bhikkhunīs. 66 Needless
gender distinction. It thus indicates the precise opposite of Banks Findly’s conclusions.
Similar listings of various persons considered worthy of gifts can be found in DN 23 at
DN III 253, 27 , DN 23 at DN III 255, 3 , AN 2.4 at AN I 63, 6 , AN 7.14 at AN IV 10, 21 , AN 7.16 at
AN IV 13, 10 , AN 7.80 at AN IV 145, 16 , AN 8.59 at AN IV 292, 8 , AN 9.10 at AN IV 373, 1 , and
Sn 227. All of these passages consistently relate worthiness of gifts to accomplishment
at various levels of realization, without the slightest hint at any type of gender discrim-
ination.
Sāriputta’s attainment of fully awakening is described in terms of his being free from
the āsavas in MN 74 at MN I 501, 5 (cf. also MN 111 at MN III 28, 26 ) and Th 996; for the
same in relation to Mahākassapa cf. SN 16.9 at SN II 214, 22 , SN 16.10 at SN II 271, 14 , and
Th 1061. Although other expressions are of course also used to express their attainment
of full liberation, as far as I am able to ascertain neither of these two bhikkhus is explic-
itly qualified as an arahant in the Pāli discourses or in the Pāli Vinaya.
65
References to bhikkhunīs mentioned by name and qualified as being free from the
āsavas can be found, for example, in Thī 4 (Tissā), Thī 126 (Candā), Thī 181 (Uttarā), Thī
336f (Sundarī), Thī 364 (Subhā Kammāradhītā), and Thī 389 (Subhā Jīvakambavanikā);
leaving aside Thī 121, where the same is used in relation to thirty unnamed bhikkhunīs.

to say, one who has eradicated the influxes is as worthy of offerings as
anyone who is explicitly designated with the epithet arahant. 67
Contrary to the suggestion by Banks Findly, in at least one case
an individual bhikkhunī is explicitly designated as an arahant, together
with her son. The passage occurs in the Vinaya as part of the Sudinna
narrative that forms the background for the promulgation of the pārājika
regulation against sexual intercourse. 68 The passage mentions Sudinna,
his wife, and his son Bījaka, followed by indicating “at a later time the
two went forth from the home to homelessness and realized arahant-
ship.” 69
Banks Findly (59 note 8) finds the passage ambiguous, since ac-
cording to her it could intend father and son. Hence she concludes, set-
ting aside the indications provided by Horner (34 note 1) and Malala-
sekera (293), that “the ambiguity of the construction precludes the de-
finitive attribution of the title arahant to Bījaka’s mother.” This seems to
be the result of a misunderstanding of the narrative context. Already at
the time of fathering Bījaka, Sudinna had been a bhikkhu. Thus he had
definitely gone forth from the home to homelessness a long time before
his son could ever do so. As Sudinna was the bhikkhu responsible for oc-
casioning a rule against sexual intercourse, he was not punished and
thus was not in any need to ordain again. 70 Therefore, the passage de-
The status of being free from the āsavas is ascribed in SN 5.3 at SN I 130, 23 to Kisā-
gotamī with the help of the expression viharāmi anāsavā. This expression has a counter-
part in viharāmi anāsavo found precisely in Th 336 mentioned above in note 64 (cf. also
Th 47). Therefore, just as the bhikkhu speaker of Th 336 is worthy of offerings because
he dwells without influxes, so too Kisāgotamī must be considered worthy of offerings.

This follows a basic principle enunciated explicitly at the end of the exposition of the
first pārājika in Vin III 33, 32 : anāpatti . . . ādhikammikassā ti, according to which the origi-

scribing a going forth of those who then become arahants can only in-
tend the mother and the son, as in fact explicitly indicated in the com-
mentary. 71
Turning to Jain texts by way of providing some contextualization
in the ancient Indian setting, Roth (Mallī-jñāta 48) notes that, from the
moment the female saint Mallī is explicitly qualified as an arahant, the
Nāyādhammakahāo switches to employing masculine forms to refer to
her, even though she is still a woman. Roth (Mallī-jñāta 139 note 92) ex-
plains that even today Jains use masculine forms when addressing a
woman in order to express reverence.
In sum, the rare application of the term arahant to women in Pāli
discourse and Vinaya literature need not be seen as an attempt to de-
prive fully awakened bhikkhunīs of their worthiness to receive offerings
by faithful donors.
nal perpetrator is not guilty precisely because up to that point no corresponding rule
had been promulgated. Therefore the one who occasions a rule is invariable exempt
from punishment.
Sp I 215, 24 explains that the reference to the two who went forth and became arahants
intends Bījaka and his mother. Clarke (192 note 99) notes that parallel passages in the
Dharmaguptaka, Mahīśāsaka, Mūlasarvāstivāda, and Sarvāstivāda Vinayas only mention
the son’s attainment of arahant-ship; cf. T 1428 at T XXII 570a 28 , T 1421 at T XXII 3a 29 , T
1442 at T XXIII 629a 15 , and T 1435 at T XXIII 1b 16 . Thus the Theravāda Vinaya stands out
for explicitly mentioning also the attainment of arahant-ship by the mother. Elsewhere,
the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya, Dutt (22, 9 ), uses the expression arahantinī; a usage already
noted by Edgerton (67) and Finnegan (200 note 10); for a study of arahatīs cf. also Feer.

Conclusion
To conclude, the paucity of examples of the term arahantī does not imply
that the ability of women to reach full awakening was not recognized.
Similarly, the use of the nominative bhikkhu does not reflect gender dis-
crimination.
With regards to the vocative, bhikkhave appears to be an example
of an idiomatic plural vocative used to convey more than its simple lit-
eral sense. By the time of the collating/composing/writing down of the
extant aṭṭhakathās (whenever we understand that to be) the idea of the
vocative address to monks as idiomatic—i.e. conveying more than the
literal meaning and intending to mean “Monks and all present”—seems
to have become imbricated into the tradition.
We would like to conclude with a note on the question of transla-
tion and the question: does or should the evidence and arguments pre-
sented above impact on how we translate the terms? Our answer to this
is that we think it is helpful to indicate, in a publication—and especially
with a publication that includes use of the terms in Pāli—the broader
parameters of meaning in relation to bhikkhave and bhikkhu. To translate
the terms with a purely literal meaning, just as “Monk” or “Monks,” does
fail to capture the broader meaning of the terms that are revealed
through detailed analysis and that were (at least) adhered to by some
communities in the course of the history of Buddhist traditions. To
translate the terms simply as “Monk” or “Monks” can easily lead to mis-
understanding, such that the assumption is that the teaching or teach-
ings are addresses only to the monks, or intended to be applicable only
to male monastics. Yet, and this is perhaps the main point we make with
this paper, early Buddhist teachings explicitly addressed to male monas-
tics should not be interpreted to be invariably aimed solely at them.Collett and Anālayo, Bhikkhave and Bhikkhu in Early Buddhist Texts

\*2: In the present article, parts 1, 2, 4, and 5 are by Alice Collett and parts 3, 6, and 7 are by Anālayo. Alice Collett presented an earlier version of some parts of this paper under the title “*Aṭṭhakathā* Exegesis of *Bhikkhave*” at the XVIIth Congress of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, University of Vienna, August 2014. She would like to thank the following people for their kind input to this paper: Bhikkhu Bodhi, Simon Brodbeck, Paul Dundas, Timothy Lenz, Patrick Olivelle, Blair Silverlock and Martin Seeger.
\*3: We will use the term *bhikkhave* throughout, except when quoting examples in which the form *bhikkhavo* is used.
\*4: See Anālayo (*Comparative* 21–22) for the most frequently occurring difference between uses of *bhikkhave* and *bhikkhavo*, and for a list of other works that discuss this.
\*5: Translation of SN III 33 by Bhikkhu Bodhi (with one change) (*Connected*, 877). Bhikkhu Bodhi often does not translate every instance of the word *bhikkhave*. In his translation of this section, he leaves out the third occurrence.
\*6: The difference between the Pāli and Chinese versions may be due to the translators of the texts from Indic languages to Chinese removing the vocative.
\*7: In the Mahāsāṅghika-Lokottaravāda *Bhikṣuṇī Vinaya*, when the Buddha pronounces individual rules, a vocative can appear if the rule includes prescribing a personal address to the nun who in that instance broke the rule, in which case she would be addressed with the standard *ayye*.
\*8: D 6 tha 111b 6 or Q 1035 de 107a 4 : *gau ta mī dag*. In the Chinese counterpart, T 1451 at T XXIV 248b 22 , the Buddha uses only the address “you” (plural), 汝等, not a proper name. For a more detailed study of the tale of Gautamī and her followers wishing to enter final Nirvāṇa cf. Anālayo (“Miracle”).
\*9: Cf., e.g., DN 16 at DN II 138, 23 .
\*10: MN 68 at MN I 463, 11 to 463, 14 .
\*11: MN 31 at MN I 206, 9 and MN 128 at MN III 155, 34 (in each case giving only the first occurrence of the plural form, which continues throughout the respective discourses).
\*12: Vin II 12, 29 to 12, 32 ; the same recurs at Vin III 182, 34 .
\*13: Vin II 199, 18 to 199, 21 .
\*14: Warder (165 note 4) comments in relation to another such instance, where the plural *vāseṭṭhā* (found in C e and S e , and noted as a variant in the E e edition at DN III 81 note 1) forms the way of addressing the two Brahmin friends Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja, that this is a case of the “vocative plural, the second name being understood as included in the first”.
\*15: According to Sn 557, Sāriputta kept rolling the wheel of Dharma set in motion by the Buddha, wherefore Ud 2.8 at Ud 17, 29 and Th 1083 reckon him the “general of the Dharma”.
\*16: As noted by Blair Silverlock, the problem may have to do with how Gāndhārī scribes recorded plurals and singulars. I would like to thank Blair for kindly sharing some sections of his soon-to-be completed doctoral thesis on scroll no. 12 from the Senior Collection.
\*17: I would like to thank Patrick Olivelle for his comments to me on this matter.
\*18: Mbh references are to the Vulgate edition.
\*19: I would like to thank Paul Dundas for his comments to me on this matter.
\*20: One other type of idiomatic plural vocative that there is some evidence for is the *pluralis majestaticus*, the plural of respect for deceased persons, as noted by Schopen (176-7), and myself (Collett, forthcoming), in relation to inscriptions. There is also some evidence of this in other Sanskrit works, but this usage does not account for our findings above, as in these cases the plural is clearly used to address the living.
\*21: Ps I 18, 24 .
\*22: Ps I 301, 29 .
\*23: Spk I 29, 8 .
\*24: Ps I 13, 29 : *Bhikkhavo ti āmantanākāra-dīpanaṃ; tañ ca bhikkhanasīlatādi guṅayogasiddhattā vuttaṃ*, repeated at Spk II 1, 19 and Mp I 17, 12 .
\*25: *Aparesu pi devamanussesu vijjamānesu kasmā bhikkhū yeva āmantesī ti ce?*
\*26: *Jeṭṭha-seṭṭhāsanna-sadāsannihita-bhāvato. Sabbaparisa-sādhāraṇā hi bhagavato dhamma-desanā, parisāyañ ca jeṭṭhā bhikkhū paṭhamuppannattā; seṭṭhā anagāriyabhāvaṃ ādiṃ katvā satthu cariyānuvidhāyakattā sakalasāsana-paṭiggāhakattā ca* (Mp I 18, 1-5 . Ps has *parisānañ* for *parisāyañ*).
\*27: *Āsannā te, tattha nisinnesu satthu santikattā, sadāsannihitā, satthu santikāvacarattā ti. Api ca, te dhammadesanāya bhājanaṃ yathānusiṭṭhaṃ paṭipattisambhāvato ti pi te āmantesi* (Mp I 18, 8 , reading *santikāvacarattā* for Walleser’s *santikā va carattā*. There are also some differences in Spk and Ps).
\*28: I have previously drawn attention to the usage of *bhikkhu* instead of *bhikkhunī* in the *Cetokhila-sutta* and the *Yuganaddha-sutta*, in comparison with their parallels, in Anālayo (“Theories” 117f).
\*29: The translated part is taken from SĀ 615 at T II 172a 26 to b 10 . Here and elsewhere I adopt Pāli for proper names and doctrinal terms (except for anglicized terms like Dharma) in order to facilitate comparison with the Pāli discourse parallels, without thereby intending to take a position on the original language of the text on which the Chinese translation was based.
\*30: The title I supplement follows Akanuma (65), the original text does not provide a title.
\*31: The parallel SN 47.10 at SN V 154, 20 simply reports that Ānanda, taking his robes and bowl, went to a certain monastic dwelling place of *bhikkhunīs*.
\*32: SN 47.10 at SN V 154, 22 just indicates that Ānanda sat down on a prepared seat.
\*33: According to SN 47.10 at SN V 154, 28 , the *bhikkhunīs* informed Ānanda that being well established in the four *satipaṭṭhānas* they had reached higher stages of distinction.
\*34: In the corresponding reply in SN 47.10 at SN V 155, 2 , Ānanda refers to *bhikkhus* and *bhikkhunīs* who practice in this way.
\*35: SN 47.10 at SN V 155, 12 repeats the full account, instead of abbreviating.
\*36: SĀ 615 at T II 172b 13 to b 18 .
\*37: In the corresponding statement in SN 47.10 at SN V 155, 31 , the Buddha also just speaks of a *bhikkhu* contemplating the body, without mentioning *bhikkhunīs*.
\*38: SN 47.10 at SN V 156, 2 adds that the mind is distracted externally.
\*39: SN 47.10 at SN V 156, 4 simply indicates that the *bhikkhu* should direct the mind towards an inspiring sign (*nimitta*).
\*40: My translation is based on the assumption that a reference to 身 here renders an instrumental *kāyena* in the Indic original, which in such contexts functions as an idiomatic expression to convey personal and direct experience; cf. Schmithausen (214 and 249 ad. note 50), Radich (263), Harvey (180 note 10), and Anālayo (*Comparative* 379f note 203).
\*41: Cf. above note 37.
\*42: MĀ 206 at T I 780b 17 to b 20 .
\*43: EĀ 51.4 at T II 817a 17 to a 20 .
