# On German translations

SuttaCentral Voice hosts new segmetned German translations by Anagarika Sabbamitta, as well as all existing German translations that can be found on SuttaCentral.
## Why new translations?

*Anagarika Sabbamitta, 2020*

The German speaking world is in the fortunate position that there are already many German translations of Early Buddhist Texts. The Pali canon is mostly covered, and German has been among the first European languages into which Buddhist texts have been translated.

For a long time I was very content with this situation, and it didn't occur to me that something else could be required.

Until … well, until I came across Bhikkhu Bodhi's English translations. This was the first time that I was less content with the existing German translations; and from then on I would read the Suttas more or less exclusively in English.

When in 2018 Bhante Sujato published his new Englsih translations on SuttaCentral this was another experience that moved me into the same direction. In this version the Suttas would sound so fresh and vivid and I very much enjoyed reading them. And bit by bit there would grow the wish to share this joy with my fellow country people who don't understand English.

In no way however would I like to debase the excellent accomplishments of previous German translators. With their work they made it possible that the Buddha's teaching was already known in German-speaking countries a long time ago and has inspired mayn people. And new translations will always be built on the basis of what exists already. As Bhante Sujato put it on one eccasion: Any new translator is standing on the shoulders of giants!

Also, there will never be the *one and only* perfect translation that's valid forever. Society is changing, language is changing, reading habits too are changing … maybe each generation will have to produce its own new translations.

My own work, in any case, I don't see as something that's supposed to carve the Buddhist canon in German language in stone for all times. What I can clearly say is that it is very fruitful for myself to do this work and dive into the Suttas in this way. My hope is that others too may benefit from my approach and that the Suttas will be a bit easier accessible at least for some people, and that some may perhaps share in the deep joy that's connected with these texts for me.

Now let me denote a few points that make new translations appear desirable from my point of view:

- So far there is no consistent German translation of the Pali canon. Quality and linguistic design vary greatly. Not even for each of the four main Nikāyas is there a consistent translation: The extant translation of the Saṁyutta Nikāya is by three different translators.
- Many of the existing translations are difficult to read for modern readers. Some have been created 100 – 150 years ago and are using a language that's often not easily comprehensible any more. Much of it has been written by linguists for linguists and hasn't necessarily been intended for a wider public. And even in the works of those translators who intended to write for the people next door we often find coined words which don't make sense to someone without a previus in-depth study of Buddhist philosophy or also Pali. What should a reader who is new to the suttas understand for example by a word like “Genügensreiz” (Hellmuth Hecker for *nandīrāga*) or “programmierte Wohlerfahrungssuche” (Paul Debes for *viññāṇa*)?
- Another point is that in the language of the Pali canon the male gender is very predoninamt. This too is something that doesn't seem appropriate any more in the modern society. Alice Collett and Venerable Anālayo have shown in their study *Bhikkhave and Bhikkhu as Gender-inclusive Terminology in Early Buddhist Texts* (<a href="http://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/?s=analayo+bhikkhave" target="_blank">PDF for download</a>) that many of the grammatically masculine terms like *bhikkhu* or *bhikkhave* are in fact used in an inclusive sense. That means if the Buddha addresses his audience as *bhikkhave* he isn't exclusively talking to male monastics sitting in the company but to nuns just as well, and at times to laypeople too. A general rendering of *bhikkhave* as “monks” doesn't do justice neither to the situation in ancient India nor to the demands of a modern gender inclusive language.
- My last point is of technical nature: None of the existing German translations have so far been segmented. For *text segments* as used on SuttaCentral and Voice see [here](/sc-voice/en/201-segmentation). Segmenting existing translations requires a great amount of work and time.

The biggest problem that I saw when thinking about a translation of the Suttas is the fact that my knowledge of Pali is limited. An independent translation of a Plai text would be a challenge I wouldn't feel able to cope with. For this reason I decided to rely on Bhante Sujato's new English translations. And it's coming in useful that the SuttaCentral development team is building the software <a href="https://bilara.suttacentral.net/" target="_blank">Bilara</a>, a computer assisted translation tool which allows for trilingual work. The text is displayed segment-wise side by side in Pali and English and can be translated into a third language. For a segment in progress the translation memory shows examples how this or a similar passage has already been translated elsewhere.

This allows for a translation with a high degree of consistency and even with incomplete knowledge of Pali, since it is always possible to view the English translation along with the Pali.

In addition, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/scv-bilara" target="_blank">scv-bilara</a>, developed by Karl Lew and used in Voice, provides a trilingual search function which is very useful.

I've started my translation project about mid-2019. I intend to translate the four main Nikāyas of the Pali canon and the early parts of the Khuddaka Nikāya. So far the following Suttas have been translated:
- **AN**: book of the Ones, Twos, and Threes; book of the Fours in progress; AN 5.57; AN 5.155; AN 7.36; AN 10.48, 10.60-61
- **SN**: SN 1.1; SN 3.21; SN 5.2; SN 10.8; SN 12.1-33; SN 22.59; SN 35.28; SN 42.11; SN 45.8; SN 56.11
- **MN**: MN 2, MN 7, MN 23, MN 33
- **DN**: DN 33

New texts are continually added, existing texts are regularly updated.

You can listen to or read all Suttas in Voice, with or without the corresponding Pali text as desired. If you enter an ID into the search box for a Sutta that I haven't yet translated a legacy text will be returned. For all search terms other than a Sutta ID, as well as when using the <kbd>Inspire me!</kbd> button, for technical reasons only segmented texts will be searched.

Feedback to the translations is most welcome. You can send an email to dhammaregen@gmail.com or address me on the SuttaCentral discussion forum <a href="https://discourse.suttacentral.net" target="_blank">Discourse.SuttaCentral</a>.
