Index of Similes
This is a modified version of the Index of Similes from Access to Insight. We adapt this useful resource with gratitude. Changes include:

Removing all later texts and references, retaining only references directly to the early texts.
In a few cases, terminology and definitions have been changed, corrected, or deleted. However, the bulk of the content is identical.
HTML structure is modified.
Diacritical marks have added.
Links go to SuttaCentral.
In most cases, Access to Insight and SuttaCentral use the same reference conventions. However, in a few cases they differ; for example Sutta Nipāta is Sn in Access to Insight and Snp in SuttaCentral. In such cases the references have been changed to SuttaCentral’s system.
The caveats expressed by the author of the original index still apply:

Only the imagery that illustrates points of Dhamma is included here; imagery that serves primarily a literary or narrative function is not included.
In addition, note the following:

References only include the Pali texts.
